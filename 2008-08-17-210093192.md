I've become increasingly annoyed with my blog's design. It's …too much.
There's a sidebar, there's a tag cloud, there's the archives, there's whatnots
and doodads and stuff. Funny; a few months ago I've installed it to make the
site more lightweight, and had the feeling I had succeeded. (Take a look at my
still unchanged [tumblelog][1] to see the old design.)

Still, over the last few weeks I felt the urge to further strip it down.

Is less more? Well… I think so. Less clutter, less noise, less fluff. (At
least outside the blog posts.) Let's focus on the actual meat! If there is
any.

Plus I've tried to read one of my posts using the highly useful
[Instapaper][2] application on my iPod touch, in its text mode, and got
seriously annoyed. So much crap to scroll through just to get to the actual
article -- archive, tag cloud, about blurb etc.

This warranted a change.

So, taking a lot of inspiration and hints of [Jack Shedd][3] and [Ryan
Tomayko][4] -- read: fusing their wonderful respective designs into a freaky
bastard child -- I've managed to come up with a light and mostly clutter-free
layout that's both easy on the eyes and pleasing [Instapaper][2]'s text
mode [^1].

I've removed everything I've deemed unnecessary. Like the sidebar, the
external links, the archive, the list of tags, the blurbs, the doodads and
whatnots. The article display has been cleaned up and I've removed the
"related pages" section. Internally, I've switched the site from [Textile][6]
to [Markdown][7], and fully migrated the comments from the built-in Wordpress
system to [Disqus][8].

I am pretty happy with the results.

It looks fine in both Safari 3 and Firefox 3. It's a bit broken in IE6 (big
surprise), and I don't have an IE7 here right now. But since I'm slighly drunk
at the moment, I don't really care. I'm not a designer, clearly, but I think
it's good nonetheless. :)

Huzzah!

**Update:** Looks good in MSIE 7, 8 and Opera 9.5x. Thank you, [Browsershots][9].
