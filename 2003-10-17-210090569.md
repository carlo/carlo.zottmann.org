[Wired.com][1]: _"An implanted male hormonal contraceptive is now being
tested._

It works in much the same way as its female counterpart, which uses the
hormones estrogen and progestin to shut off the release of eggs to prevent
pregnancy. In the male version, testosterone and progestin are used to turn
off sperm production.

"The hormones work by suppressing the production of two other hormones from
the brain -- LH (luteinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone),"
said Dr. Christina Wang, professor at Harbor-UCLA Research & Education
Institute."

Very cool. About time, I'd say. And I'm saying that _because_ I am a male. I
like to have more options in this field, really.

BTW, am I the only one finding it funny that the researcher who was
interviewed bears the name "Wang"? (Yeah, probably too much [Penny Arcade][2]
on my mind at the momentâ€¦ I apologize. Still, it's funny IMHO.)
