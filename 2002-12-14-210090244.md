This is the first time I write my MCN from home. But hey - it's the first day
of my three weeks vacation! w00p! :)

I plan on working on [Class.Jabber.PHP][1] a bit next week - and seeing a
couple of my friends. ;) Got some things in mind I want to add soon(tm), and
then I'll change the license it's distributed under from [JOSL][2] to
[GPL][3]. Should make things easier (legally) for other Open Source devs to
use the class in their projects.

Currently thinking about adding [MetaWeblog API][4] support to GLUE. Not too
sure, tho. At first I just wanted to add some nice Jabber support (make
entries via Jabber), then I thought about it, and if I actually do that I
might add another node to the process - Jabber --> MetaWeblog API --> GLUE.
Thoughts?

My personal "comic strip of the day": [Ivy][5]. (Little translation - panel
one: "Love is blindingâ€¦", panel two: "Vewy fummy").

Have a great weekend, y'all.
