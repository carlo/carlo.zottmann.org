My big "semi-sister" accepted an honest proposal made to her by her boyfriend.
In short, [they'll get married][1]. Congrats, my dear Susi. I'm so glad you
finally got your ass up, Andreas. ;) I already thought I'd see her implode
with excitement over this relationship before you were able to ask her, hehe.

This reminds me that my baby sister and her boyfriend decided to get married a
while ago _as well_. I was totally sure I've posted this here already, but
apparently I didn't. Damn you, my weak mind! Anyways, my "real" sister is
getting married, too. Which I suspected to happen for the last three or four
years alreadyâ€¦ turns out I've foreseen the future once again. ;) So, belated
congratulations to you, too, Claudia! And Tino, of course!

Man, next year is gonna be wedding'ish to the max. Funk!
