Oiy. [Microsoft announces interoperability between CardSpace and OpenID][1]:

> On the heels of the Windows® CardSpace™ general availability launch in
Windows Vista™, Microsoft demonstrated momentum with industry partners that
are working to apply this technology to help consumers realize a more
confident online experience. This includes the announcement of collaboration
on use of Windows CardSpace with the OpenID 2.0 specification. Through the
support of the WS-Trust-based Windows CardSpace experience, consumers can take
advantage of increased security against phishing attacks without adding
complexity to their identity management experience.

Some clarifications and what it all means [by JanRain CEO Scott Kveton][2]
[[via][3]]:

> JanRain will never **require** users of our libraries or services to use
Windows CardSpace™. We offer support for this technology as another option for
users much like using our Safe SignIn and Personal Icon technologies on
MyOpenID.com. We’ll also continue to support the OpenID efforts going on with
Mozilla and Firefox.

(For more meat, read [Scott’s blog post][2].)

It’s still sinking in at this point, but damn, this is _big_.
