**Summing up YouTube.** [xkcd][1] does an excellent job of taking a snapshot of YouTube in one single comic strip.

**It’s art!** [jr has an iNsight][2]

> Apple is not a business. It’s an art co-op.

**Project Censored: Top 25 Censored Stories of 2007.** Interesting list. I “liked” #2, [Halliburton Charged with Selling Nuclear Technologies to Iran][3].

**How old is the Grand Canyon?** [Park service won’t say][4]:

> Grand Canyon National Park is not permitted to give an official estimate of
the geologic age of its principal feature, due to pressure from Bush
administration appointees.

**Dick in a box.** [IKEA instructions for making a DIAB.][5]

**AG?** [Nine year old Wired story][6], still fascinating and mindboggling:

> Skeptics had a field day when a scientist claimed in 1996 that gravity could
be negated. Now his findings are being investigated in laboratories worldwide.

[**Solid State Disk Changes The Game**][7] [via [Simon][8]]:

> And, it will change the way your software runs. When there’s little penalty
in saving to disk, there’s no reason not to. Your changes are stored as your
writing the memo, or playing with the spreadsheet.
