G'day, you've reached the personal site of Carlo Zottmann.  I'm a
[freelance software developer](http://municode.de), minimalist runner,
videogames enthusiast, coffee devotee and husband from Munich, Germany.

![That's me.](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7298/blog/me.jpg)

I build "applications" or "sites" for them so-called "internets".  Among my
past and present projects are [foto-bundesliga](http://foto-bundesliga.de), a
German-language league game site for photographers,
[TwerpScan](http://twerpscan.com), a Twitter contact list management tool,
and [Ephemera](http://goephemera.com/), a Mac tool for Instapaper enthusiasts
with ebook readers (open-sourced by now).

I'm running with the cool kids!  Find me on [Github](http://github.com/carlo),
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/municode) and
