The aforementioned tech article [is available now on YUIblog.com][1]! It’s
explaining a way to use the excellent [YUI library][2] in [Greasemonkey][3]
scripts. I’m sure that this approach is neither the perfect nor the only
solution to achieving YUI/Greasemonkey integration, but it works for me and I
thought sharing can’t hurt.

Well, the article is [here][1], and the example script can be downloaded [from
this very site here][4].

Many thanks to Eric Miraglia for giving me a soapbox. :)

If you have comments and suggestions about the implementation, feel free to
post a comment to [the actual article][1].
