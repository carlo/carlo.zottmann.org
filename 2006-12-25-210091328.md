When [Jon Stewart][1] mentioned “Hanukkah Harry” the other day during an
episode of [The Daily Show][2], I thought he had made that name up there on
the spot. Or at least made it up as a joke for that particular show.

Turns out I was wrong. [Hanukkah Harry][3] actually has his own story and
everything. And it’s so much better than Santa’s.

Oy, presents!
