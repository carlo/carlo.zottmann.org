By the way, I've cancelled my US subscription and set up shop at Argent Dawn
EU.

Ambea, Tauren druid. A wholly new experience. First, the damn timezones "lag"
is gone. The first evening of play in Mulgore I was wondering whether my video
card was broken, until I realized I was witnessing night fall. Oh right, none
of that -6hrs shit anymore! Very good.

Then there are so many people. Again, playing in the same timezone as everyone
else is really making a difference.

And then the Battlegrounds. I had the opportunity to enter Warsong Gulch
**once** during my time on Argent Dawn US, Alliance side. First of all,
timezones. Then the Alliance/Horde ratio. It always felt like there were like
10 Alliance people per 1 Horde player, which made finding an enemy BGs group
somewhat hard.

EU + Horde side == BG every time I want. w00t!

Anyways, gimme a shout if you're around.
