I hereby proclaim the new official term to describe the casting show /
petridish cloning boy/girl band "music":

**ProstiPop**.

"Prosti" as in "prostitutes", "pop" as in "pop music". It's not that far
fetched if you think about it. They want fame and money _now_, without much
work (face it, kidsâ€¦ one or two months in a "talent camp" is _nothing_
compared to a life full of devotion and hard work), they are willing to sell
their soul as well as their bodies/looks (as in "they're just puppets, Jim")
for media coverage, and they are fine with the idea to not have old friends as
band members but complete strangers.

Thus, I think they qualify as prostitutes.

They _might_ not do the producers, but if you are willing to sign 20-year
contracts (!) just to become yet another no-talent ass-clown on national TV
then you're either desperate or an idiot or both.

What do you think?

PS: I also proclaim the term "YANTASCONT" ("yet another no-talent ass-clown on
national TV") to be a valid new media buzzword. PPS: Spread the word, stop the
ProstiPoppers.
