Title: You've got mail

Another Sobig worm is making its rounds. It doesn't make use of any hidden
security holes, it solely utilizes the stupidity of people. I still can't
understand why people are opening attachments from people they don't know.

So the worm is spreading like a fucking wildfire, scans the infected PC for
email addresses, and sends out mails using the found addresses as either
sender or recipient. Somewhere, it found some of my old company email
addresses, and now I'm getting tons of "you suck, please fuck yourself and die
noisily" mails from virus walls and other companies' security countermeasures
which think I sent those mails.

Within the last 18 hours I got roughly 1300 mails here. Okay, it's my office
account, but this is the one I couldn't install SpamBayes for. Fucking great.
So right now I'm constantly finetuning my damn simple Outlook rule based
filters, but some are still coming thru.

I wish virus killers were mandatory. EVERYWHERE.
