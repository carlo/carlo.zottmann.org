**Get it out there.**  I fell in love with [localtunnel](http://progrium.com/localtunnel/) this week: _"The easiest way to share localhost web servers to the rest of the world"_.  Let's say you want to temporarily share your local dev server (running on port 3000) with the outside world, i.e. a client or a colleague.  Run the server as usual, then do a `gem install localtunnel && localtunnel 3000`.  Boom, done.  Your local server will be available on the URL the gem will output (`http://xyz.localtunnel.com`).  It's similar to [showoff.io](http://showoff.io) but it's free.

**Blast from the past.**  [Baldur's Gate for iPad was announced.](http://www.baldursgate.com/news/2012/03/21/baldurs-gate-enhanced-edition-for-ipad-3/)  Yes!

**Mail on iPhone.**  [Sparrow for iPhone](http://sparrowapp.com/iphone.php) is a thing of beauty.  The current v1.0 doesn't have push, but I can very well live with that.  Now if there only was a way to make Sparrow the default mail client…

On a related note, I'm not a big mail-on-handheld nut, i.e. I actively try to avoid doing mail on my phone as much as possible, for the same reason I try to avoid playing games on it — my brain needs some downtime every now and then, and generating input everytime I wait in line for a minute is preventing it from generating any output.  It's unable to create while consuming.

**Lost in Space**.  Fascinating stories from the early Russian space program, uncovered by [two Italian youngsters in the mid 1950-1960s using their self-made radio equipment](http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/1302/lost_in_space.html).

**The Dow Jones is fukken broken.**  The New York Times asks, ["Why Do We Still Care About the Dow?"](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/magazine/dow-jones-problems.html?_r=3&pagewanted=all)  As someone who isn't a finance worker person, I have to say the article makes a compelling case against keeping the Dow Jones around.

**RUIN.**  Last but not least: a 8-min CGI short movie for your enjoyment.
