So I have 100 invites for this new site called [Spock.com][1]. In a nutshell,
I see it as Wikipedia + search engine, but just about people. It’s an
interesting approach. For a general quick explanation, feature list, a few
screenshots and all around overview, see [this TechCrunch article][2].

The interesting thing is that it’s not a social network, but more of a meta-
hub that allows you to find, tag and describe yourself and/or others. Like a
mix of [Jyte][3] and [ClaimID][4]. It’ll be interesting to see it either take
off completely (like Wikipedia) or tank completely (because of malicious
users).

Anyways, I have invites to give away. If anyone is interested, leave a comment
below or email me at carlo@zottmann.org. I’ll need your email address for
that.

And if you already have access to it, stop by [my entry][5].
