[Hendrik moves to Brighton, UK.][1] I still don’t have much to say about that,
I am glad for him, but that doesn’t make me feel better about seeing my best
friend moving away. :/ I can totally understand his notion, tho - I’ve been at
the same point myself a few years ago - so it’s alright.

Well, we also still have the intertubes.

Anyways, he’s also looking for work. If you’re in or around Brighton and
searching for a freelance Rails consulting/development ninja, you should at
least [look him up][2]. :)
