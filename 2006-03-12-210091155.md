My good friend [Hendrik][1] gave birth (_ewww_) to a new site (_phewâ€¦_) called
[25peeps.com][2]. Now, here's the scoop:

  1. I have no fucking idea _what_ this site is.
  2. He wrote it in just 2 hours.
  3. At the moment, my picture is pretty much at the top, which makes this site so much more attractive. ;)

It's sort of a social-networking-meets-pr0n-thumbnail-gallery-site-meets-
linkblo g-meets-OMG-I'm-on-the-internet thing. As I've said, I don't know
what's up with it. It's almost freakishly small (just two or three pages), and
seems to have no real purpose; but I know Hendrik, he's got those mad-
scientist net smarts, I like what he's doing, so I'm just pointing you there.
Take a look and tell me what you think.

Oh, and post your picture. :)

[25peeps.com][2] - seriously, WTF. :)
