Good entertainment. They’ve painted some grand pictures there; I’ve enjoyed
the visual style. Loved the presentation; the fighting scenes with the
slow/full motion switches were very well done. Featured strong women, always a
plus.

Wasn’t as visionary as the hype wanted me to believe, but it has most
certainly set a new high in action cinematography for me—it’s as much a visual
milestone as _The Matrix_ was back then. (Other than that you can’t compare
those two flicks.)

[Faramir][1] didn’t really fit in, I think. Good performance, but his blond
hair stood out a bit too much.

I still don’t think it [should be called ‘600’][2], tho.

Had the right length.

PS: I don’t feel like barking “This is Sparta!” repeatedly at all. I want my
money back.
