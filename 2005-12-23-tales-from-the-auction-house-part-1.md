Bought an [Hakkari Coin][1] at the AH for the great price of 5g 78s. Wanted to
resell it for a better price (better for me).

When I realized I had put it up for auction for 7**s** minimum bid and 9**s**
buyout, it was to late. Argh!

Well, live and learn. Thank God it wasn't real money. :)

World of Warcraft, giving you all the joy and excitement of Ebay without the
real life pain you might go throughâ€¦
