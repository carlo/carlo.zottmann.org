Last night I've released a new version of [Ephemera, my 2-way Instapaper
/ebook-reader sync tool for Mac.][1]

Here's what's new:

  * NEW: The app runs on both 32 and 64 bit Snow Leopard now.
  * NEW: When auto-sync is enabled and you plug in your reading device, Ephemera will show a "Going to sync…" dialog for 5 seconds, where you can temporarily disable syncing.
  * NEW: Support for password-less Instapaper accounts.
  * FIX: Preferences menu item will be correctly disabled during sync.
  * FIX: Multiple concurrent syncs will not stall anymore.
  * PLEASE NOTE: Involuntary archiving of all your unread articles at each sync will happen if you've set your Instapaper account to automatic archiving. [See this support thread for how to change said Instapaper setting.][2]

I'm especially happy about the 32 bit compatibility. Turns out I've managed to
dig up [an issue in MacRuby 0.5][3]. Thanks to [Thibault][4] and the rest of
the MR crew for hunting it down and [fixing it][5]. Hat tip, guys. :)

If you're using Ephemera already, its auto-updater will pop up soon enough. If
not, [go take a look][1].

**If you like Ephemera, feel free to spread the word** (there's a little "Share" widget on the site), or tell [IUseThis][6] how you feel about the app. Thanks!
