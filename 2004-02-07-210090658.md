I'm a [Bloglines][1] user for, what, exactly 4 months by now, and it just
crossed my mind that it is more or less my central one-stop website. I read my
daily news with Bloglines, I read my blog subscriptions with Bloglines, I read
most of my comics with Bloglines, I read my geek/programming news with
Bloglines, I read my gaming news with Bloglines.

And best of all, I can do it everywhere I have a browser with web access, and
I don't have to read anything twice or to install. I'd even pay a monthly fee
for it, that's how useful it is to me. Not that there is a monthly fee.

It's a great trend, most sites [already offer][2] RSS feeds, and the ones
which are not are often [easily scraped][3] (think of it as bootleg copies) -
heck, there are even [free automated services][4] to do the full-site-to-RSS
conversion for you.

For me, email is like the sun setting after a long day. It was a good day, but
it's about to be over. RSS is the sun at dawn of the next day. Bloglines is
the horse I ride on towards that dawning horizon. :)
