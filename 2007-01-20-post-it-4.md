**Parenting.** [Mr. Pilgrim on raising little humans][1]:

> Parenting is also like that Star Trek episode where they’re acting as
anthropologists, watching a civilization evolve at like 100 times normal
speed. (Isn’t there a Star Trek episode like that? Well there should be, damn
it, I’m trying to tell a story here.) You wake up one morning and say, “Oh my
God, Jim, they’re using tools! Next week they’ll be building spaceships!”

**Roof status.** Still there, unharmed. No storm-related damage at all. Apparently my sister wasn’t quite as lucky—her cellar/basement is a swimming pool now. Oiy.

**News reader market shares.** TechCrunch asks [How big is Google Reader?][2], and while the chart in that post looks interesting, it doesn’t say much without Google Reader telling the [Feedburner][3] bot how many subscribers are there for any given feed.

**Uncle Carlo.** My baby sister is working on developing two little humans in her womb. Soon, I’ll be an “uncle”. The jury’s still out on whether I should feel proud (current notion) or old. Congratulations, Claudia & Tino.
