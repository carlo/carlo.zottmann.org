I’ve updated my [Firefox addon BetterSearch][1] to version 1.19. The update
brings Firefox 3 and [Flock][2] compatibility and fixes the thumbnails for
[Yahoo! Search][3]. Also, it now looks a little bit better due to new icons,
c/o [FamFamFam][4].

You remember BetterSearch, right? No? Oh, okay.

> “An extension for Firefox and Flock which enhances Google (all international
flavours, too), Yahoo Search, del.icio.us, MSN Search […] by adding previews
(thumbnails) and Amazon product images and info (type, price, rating for
US/DE/UK/CA/FR products), a quick preview feature as well as “Open in New
Window”, “Site Info” and “Wayback Machine” links to the search results.”

The other changes are minor and mostly under the hood to prepare for the next
major version.

Next up: better thumbnails. Work, work…
