Yeah, I’m [in][1]. Thanks to [Hendrik][2] for the invite. I guess.

It’s strange. After two days of more or less using it I am still unable to say
if it’s cool or “just too much”. Hmm.

One thought that crossed my mind when signing up: “I wish it had OpenID
support.” Now, to me, that says more about OpenID than Pownce. :P
