### What They Call The "Real Life"

  * 2008 ended with me getting unemployed. The decision being made for me was a catalyst to finally make my move. I was planning to get out of employment in 2009 anyways, so, you know. Thank you, Yahoo!.
  * Early in the year I went freelance. As mentioned, I had played with the idea for a while by then, so that was pretty cool. And scary.
  * Got a few clients, and managed to keep a good _"client work vs. own projects"_ ratio. I'm not getting rich working like this, but I'd like to be truly happy in my job for once, so it's important for me to keep the balance there.
  * My first freelance project, a WoW-related site named [CharPool][1], was a personal success, but failed nonetheless. About a month after launching it other sites with similar functionality came out and kind of crushed it. I guess I had waited too long to act on the idea for the site. So, in December, I've turned the server off. Well, live and learn.
  * Speaking of learning, I've learned a boatload of new things this year. Lots of Ruby-related things, of course, but also a lot of *nix stuff. Fun!
  * Among other things, I rewrote my Twitter contact management site [TwerpScan][2] — and had the chance to give a [quick talk about it][3] for a mixed audience here in Munich. Another first for me, and I've enjoyed it.
  * Got myself two ebook readers, a [Bookeen Cybook Gen3][4] and a [Amazon Kindle 2][5]. Both nice, but the latter wins, hands down. What a refined piece of technology!
  * I'm currently knee-deep in RubyCocoa code, which I consider a road to MacRuby, which I need for my next big project… Loving it!
  * Finally got me an iPhone.

### Friends & Family

  * In August, I had the honor of being best man for M & E. Beautiful, beautiful wedding. It was an absolutely wonderful weekend. I love you guys. :)
  * We went up to Northern Germany for a nice vacation, including hooking up with my man [Hendrik][6] who showed us his hellhole of a city the (mostly) pretty parts of Hamburg ;), and a visit to the [BUGA 2009][7] (i.e. the annual "German Federal Horticultural Show").

### Games & Movies

  * Biggest surprises this year: [Batman: Arkham Asylum][8], [Assassin's Creed II][9]. Both games I knew about but didn't have much interest in, until [Mike][10] would lend them to me, and then… I really didn't see them coming, but they hit me _hard_. Good stuff. :)
  * Also notable this year: the two [GTA IV][11] DLC packs, [Halo 3: ODST][12], [Halo: Wars][13].
  * Avatar — holy shit. That movie really hit the spot for me. Also great: District 9. A good year for scifi, methinks.

### Verdict

  * Awesome year. Really, really good. :)

**Here's to 2010. May it be as good as 2009 was.**
