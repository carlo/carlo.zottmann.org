I am very, very fond of the wonderful [Letterhead Tumblr theme by Bill
Israel][1] which I’ve applied to [my tumblelog][2] earlier today—and currently
think about porting it to Wordpress so I can use it here.

Hmm.

**Update**: Over the next few hours, I’ll tinker w/ the site, and it might look broken. It is not (yet).
