Trying to keep track of the last one or two weeks…

  * Running again! Avoiding tarmac, thank God there are many forest roads around. Using light weights on my hands now, too. Fun. The most interesting part of the down period was that I was actually missing my runs, and that I was looking forward to start running again. I think it’s official: I like it.
  * Found out I can watch [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart][1] & [The Colbert Report][2] freely and legally on the web,OMG. Thank you, Comedy Central. Too bad there isn’t an RSS feed. [Or is there?][3]
  * [Jeremy Zawodny is leaving Yahoo!][4] – and [so is JR Conlin][5]. Bummer, two of my personal heroes gone. Well, I guess ~9 years at the same company is enough for anyone. All the best, guys!
  * [Using FriendFeed now.][6] It’s not bad, really; then again, I mostly use it to have a single place where all my loose threads come together. I really like the stalking helper [imaginary friends feature][7]. Makes it easy to keep track of pals who don’t use FriendFeed themselves. I’ve tried subscribing to the combined feed of all the people I’ve subscribed to on the site, but it’s like being fed by a firehose. Unusable, sorry. As I’ve said before, the idea to build a social network on top of peoples’ lifestreams is a bit _too meta_ for me.
  * Discovered [Goodreads][8]. Nice.
  * I love GTA IV. Incredible game. So many lovingly crafted details, amazing.
  * [New iPhones][9]! Dope. Want. And a [revamped .mac][10]! Let’s hope it works as good as it looks in the presentations. The current .mac web implementation is useless for me. It just doesn’t cut it.
