Okay, maybe that was a bit harsh, but think about it for a moment. Everyone is
complaining about power consumption and global warming and whatnot, _THE EARTH
IS DYING!!!1oneoneeleven_, yet by now it’s **really fucking hard** to find a
decent mouse or keyboard that does have a cable.

Why is that?

I seriously don’t understand why it’s necessary and accepted among computer
users to have a formerly cable-bound piece of hardware that now doesn’t “need”
a cable anymore, but batteries (rechargable or not). Or worse: the mice that
come with their own base stations and power adapters.

Mind you, your mouse and keyboard are usually around 50cm to 1m away from your
Mac or PC. So why not use something with a cable?

I am currently shopping for a new mouse, hence the confusion. Well, actually I
am annoyed. I was eying the beautiful Logitech MX Revolution, which is a
wonderful piece of equipment, is ergonomic, has the right size for my paws, it
would be perfect!

Unfortunately (for Logitech) I refuse to buy something as mundane as a
pointing device with its own PCU. Sure, they probably don’t care.

/sigh
