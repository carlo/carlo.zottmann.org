[Hail: The Return of the Sun][1] is a well-done ad/movie for solar power.
[Watch it][1], it’s pretty cool. I saw the ad in a cinema the first time, and
I found it quite good.

Staying with the topic energy & efficiency: When Dana and I moved to the new
house, we made it a point to use CFL bulbs wherever possible.

Now, after taking a long, hard look at the various doodads sitting around the
TV, which are burning energy in standby mode all day long, I’ve decided to
introduce a master/slave extension lead to the mix. So these days, when I turn
off the TV, the six other machines around it (gaming consoles, sound system,
DVR etc.) are _completely_ turned off as well automatically. It’s pretty neat,
albeit not perfect yet.

And according to my calculations the 25€ I spent on the extension lead will be
paid for by the energy bill savings within less than a year.
