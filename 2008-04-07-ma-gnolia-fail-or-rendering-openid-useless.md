I can’t really remember the other few sites where I’ve seen this, but
[Ma.gnolia’s][1] newly [added OpenID support][2] is a good example on how not
to implement OpenID.

So I go there to register an account, and sure enough, I find an OpenID form.

![Ma.gnolia OpenID form #1][3]

I click the button, allow Ma.gnolia to use my ID, and end up here:

![Ma.gnolia OpenID form #2][4]

Umm, yeah… but no. I used my OpenID so I _do not_ have to think about new
usernames. I believe that asking me to come up with an unique username
completely defies the concept of OpenID. Using OpenID in this form is like
having a story line in a porn movie. Sure, you can boast that your movie has a
plot, but who cares? It’s still just a smutty flick.

Somehow I think that one of us two isn’t completely understanding the concept
of OpenID. Is it me?

(Disclaimer: I am not discussing the overall quality of Ma.gnolia here. I
don’t use it. Others do and seem to like it, so I have no opinion in that
regard.)
