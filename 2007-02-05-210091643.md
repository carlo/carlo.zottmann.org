**Technorati WTF.** [Technorati][1] launches their [WTFsystem][2]. I see the possibility of serious abuse, but we’ll see whether I am too paranoid. Anyways, the short summary:

> Know something that’s hot? Explain why! This is your opportunity to write a
quick explanation for the buzz around a popular subject. No blog required!

**getElementsByClassName() in Firefox 3.** Native, built-in! Because [John said so][3].

**Get your URLs straight.** A [good explanation why everyone should be using disambiguated URLs][4] by (of course) Mr. Willison. (Now all I need to do is “fix” my site.)

**Presently.** Apparently [Google is working on a presentation tool][5]. Is anyone _really_ surprised? I ain’t. For the time being, I’ll stick with [S5][6], tho. But I believe Google will be taking a slightly different approach than the creator of S5, i.e. they’ll continue catering to non-geeks.
