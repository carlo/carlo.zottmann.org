So, over the last few weeks I have posted almost no entries. What can I say,
my life was wicked and weird. We went to Ireland, that was great. Still
married, which is awesome. Planning to learn Spanish for no particular reason.
Learning Ruby and Rails and dusting off my Perl skills.

Then of course, major point, I wasn't really happy at work anymore. I tried to
keep my mouth shut about the office, which is a clever thing to do, methinks;
still sometimes, the unhappiness showed.

So, I've decided to do something about it. It took a while to bring that plan
to fruition, but it succeeded.

Anyways, I gave in my several-weeks-notice today, which was a rather bizarre
feeling after over four years of working there. I still have a few weeks to go
there, which is good because there's a lot of stuff to be taken care of. Among
them, about 3 weeks of vacation time still to be spent.

So, that's the gist of what's going on at the moment.

Oh, and in October, I start working at Yahoo! Germany. :)
