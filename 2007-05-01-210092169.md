> [Halfpixel.com][1] is proud to announce an experimental new service called
“Friends for Five.” For the unimaginably low price of ten dollars, you can get
a five minute phone call from Kris and Scott, stars of the [“Kris and Scott
Power Hour”][2] (heard live ever Thursday at 6pm). For those five minutes,
Kris and Scott will indulge your fantasy and act like your life-long best
friend for five minutes.

[Posted by Scott Kurtz over at PvPonline.com][3]. This is the biggest bullshit
I’ve read in a while. Egos the size of Montana, maybe? And don’t give me the
_“they’re just joking!!1”_ treatment, because in the comments, both Kris and
Scott confirm this is actually “THE REAL DEAL” (emphasis theirs). I think you
have to be very, very convinced about yourself to offer something like this.

I can certainly understand the wish to making money without actually working,
but how does pretending to be something you are not - for money, mind you -
not make you a whore?

Thus, let me be the first one to coin this _“service”_ as totally “whore-
iffic”.

Wow.
