Jeremy Zawodny on [The Tipping Point for OpenID][1]:

> I mean that all it takes now is for one “big player” to jump on the
[OpenID][2] bandwagon. [OpenID][2] will then either take off or fall flat on
its face.

I believe it’ll succeed… in a similiar way [Jabber][3] has succeeded. A good,
solid, open system with an active developer community, but not _shiny_ enough
to appeal to the masses. Personally, I hope that it’ll fare better.

Incidently, I’ve added [OpenID][2] support on this site, so if you want to
comment on anything, you can claim your comment using your [OpenID][2] using
the very nice [OpenID for Wordpress plugin][4].

**Update 2007-01-19:** More of my OpenID musings can be found [here][5].
