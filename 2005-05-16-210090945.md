Title: Advice needed

I need a license for my new Firefox extension, but I can't find anything that
I like. Here's what I am looking for:

  * The freedom to run the program for any purpose
  * The freedom to study and modify the program for personal use
  * The freedom to copy the program

I don't want users to have the freedom to redistribute modified versions of
the program, specifically because there are links to stores etc. in it that
have my affiliate code in it. When I first distributed [BetterSearch][1] to an
extension site, it took mere hours for one of the guys to replace the original
version with one without my affiliate codes to make it "free". (Then it took
mere hours for me to politely complain, and we've come to terms since then.)

So, basically I'm looking for something like the GPL without the part that
allows users to spread modified versions of it.

Any suggestions?
