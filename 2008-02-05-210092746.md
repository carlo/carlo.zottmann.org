Hi all,

so far, [escaloop][1] has a couple of services it’s supporting explicitly,
which means there are rules to mark these services with their own service icon
and maybe an adjusted wording when they are displayed. At the time of this
post, these services are:

  * del.icio.us
  * Digg
  * Facebook
  * Flickr
  * Google (search results etc.)
  * Google Reader (shared items)
  * Last.fm
  * Livejournal
  * Magnolia
  * Newsvine
  * Pownce
  * StumbleUpon
  * Tumblr
  * Twitter
  * Vimeo
  * Vox.com

Everything else is supported implicitly, which means it’s processed and
displayed, but has no special icon or anything, it’s “just” another source.

So my question today is: do you have suggestions for other services that
should be explicitly supported? If yes, please reply to [this topic][2] and
provide both the URL to service/site as well as (if possible) an example feed
or two so I can take a look. I won’t promise to include each and every
suggestion; unfortunately, my spare time isn’t unlimited, and also it doesn’t
make sense to support everything explicitely, methinks.

Well, [please tell me what you want!][2] It certainly can’t hurt. ;) Many
thanks!

(I’ve closed the comments here, please sound off [on the escaloop discussion
board][2] instead.)
