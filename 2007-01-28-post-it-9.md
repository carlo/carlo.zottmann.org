**Yahoo! meets OpenID.** [Simon Willison][1] just [released his new site][2], [idproxy.net][3]. Basically it’s a wrapper to “transform” your [Yahoo!][4] ID into an OpenID. (To put it simple.) It’s making use of [Yahoo!s BBAuth system][5], and it quite nice. Not perfect and fully fleshed out yet, but cool already. And hey, it is secured by monsters!

**Buy MS Vista.** Seriously, there are [so many versions, there’s something for everyone][6].

**Spring?** The snow is melting, the sun is out, and we just got back from [Lehner’s][7] where we had some excellent [Kaiserschmarrn][8]. Life is good.
