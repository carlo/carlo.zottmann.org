Last night, on the way from the office to the gas station, Dana's car broke
down. Fortunately there was a tiny one-man garage at the gas station, and I
was lucky enough to have the owner see me on his way home. He spent an hour
examining the engine, then he found the problem - some rather important and
well-hidden special wire is broken, and needs to be replaced. He's going to
buy it today and call me then. Yay. Of course that's another thing that costs
this month. If I'm not completely wrong, the insurance company is collecting
the next half-year payment next month, too. Great… all expenses at once, as
always.

My mom turns 50 on Saturday, we're going there tomorrow, it's a 500-klicks
trip. We got a nice present for her, I hope she'll like it. :)

And Wil Wheaton [was cast][1] for a [new movie][2]. Congrats - even though
he'll probably never read these lines, hehe. ;)

UPDATE: the garage called - the ignition coil is broken and needs to be
replaced. Wheee… a total of $300 in unplanned car repairs, always a good
thing. _sigh_
