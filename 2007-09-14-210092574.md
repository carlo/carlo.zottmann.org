Looks like there is [a new Flickr API output format: LOL][1]. Not my work, no
idea who built this, but I really like it.

Here’s an example of returned data (`?tags=cats&amp;amp;#38;format=lol`):

> HAI

>     IM IN UR BUCKETS MAKING UP FORMATS

>     GIMME PHOTOS FROM EVERYONE TAGGED CATS WITH GEODATA

>     I CAN HAS PHOTO IMG_2326

>     ITZ AT [http://www.flickr.com/photos/blush_response/1377293729/][2]

>     INVISIBLE METADATA

>     LOL

>     KTHX.

>     I CAN HAS PHOTO IMG_2329

>     ITZ AT [http://www.flickr.com/photos/blush_response/1378198718/][3]

>     INVISIBLE METADATA

>     LOL

>     KTHX.

>     I IS BORED

>     KTHXBYE.

Grab the data [as usual][4], the `format` attribute is `lol`, apparently.

So… If you always thought about teaching your cat how to parse Flickr data,
now might be the right time to jump in. Progress!
