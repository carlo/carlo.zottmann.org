I’ve [started a tumble log][1] the other day. I consider it an experiment;
first of all, [Tumblr][2] is an _exquisite_ service with a whole lot of
potential. It serves as an extremely easy and comfortable tool to link all the
new doodads, gimmicks, funny pictures and clever quotes I find on the
Intertron.

And secondly, all the cool cats are doing it already, so there.

Thus, for the time being, I will do [what Hendrik did][3] and deactivate the
daily automated splicing of my new [del.icio.us links][4] and blog-worthy
[Flickr pictures][5] into my [tail -f carlo.log RSS feed][6], and opt for
Tumblr raking them in automatically. In addition I’ll throw in the gems I
found while reading feeds in Google Reader! What a deal!

That means if you want to keep track of the little things I see and find,
those which do not warrant a blog post on their own here, take a look [tail -f
carlo.tumblr][1]. Yes, I know the name is lame, screw you! :p There is [an RSS
feed, too][7].

So, yeah.
