I am thinking about my [linkblog][1] for a few days now, and whether to
continue it or not.

On one hand, it _is_ kind of comfortable to just [share items in Google
Reader][2] or to just store another bookmark using [Yahoo! MyWeb][3]. (An
hourly cronjob is parsing both RSS feeds and feeding it to my site.)

On the other hand, I think the [Post Its][4] are the better format. It takes
more time (and more work, even) to compile them over the course of a day, but
I am more flexible in how to present them. Plus they are part of my main
syndication feed.

Hmm.

Bye, linkblog. Itâ€™s been a nice experiment.

PS: That also means the related syndication feed will be deleted as well, of
course.
