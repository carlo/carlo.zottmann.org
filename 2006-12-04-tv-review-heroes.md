# TV Review: "Heroes"

So… [Heroes][1]. I watched the pilot and the first episodes over the last few
days, and to be honest—I couldn’t stop. It’s all around a great show so far,
from story (great) to writing (great) to acting (great) to everything else
(great).

![Heroes: Mohinder][2]Somewhere, I read something about the show along the
lines _“X-Men, before they became X-Men”_. And actually, it’s not far from the
truth. The story (or stories) are those of ordinary people today who discover
they can do extraordinary things; they are the next steps in human evolution.

Indeed, this sounds a lot like X-Men. But here they are, without a professor
in a wheelchair, without a “School for the Gifted Youngsters”, without an idea
what’s going on with them… they are alone, unsure what to do, how to continue
their lives. But in the end, these are everyday people. There’s the Japanese
worker drone who learns he can bend time and space, the drug-addicted painter
with precognitive powers, the young man who believes he can fly, the
unbreakable teenage girl who just wants to be like everyone else…

And there’s the Indian genetics scientist who figured out a way to identify
them, is murdered, and his son who wants to find out who killed him, and in
the process picks up his father’s work.

It’s somewhat hard to talk about any given episode of “Heroes” without handing
out spoilers by the dozen. So, if you haven’t already done so, make sure to
watch it, right from the beginning. Each episode has a cliffhanger that had me
staring at the screen in disbelief. Oh yes, it’s that good.

It might not be for everyone, true. But if you have a knack for superhero
stories or X-Men (the movies), you will probably love “Heroes”. In that case
make sure to visit [the official NBC site][1], too—it’s quite good, with a lot
of extras that are worth checking out. I believe you can even watch full
episodes there.
