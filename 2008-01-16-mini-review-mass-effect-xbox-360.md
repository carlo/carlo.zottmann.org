Okay, yes, I’m late to the review party. In my defense, it has something to do
with [this][1] and the fact that I wanted to finish [Mass Effect][2] twice
before rendering my judgement.

![Mass Effect - Saren][3]

So, my first playthrough on normal difficulty was
very thorough. I’ve picked a male (Infiltrator class), took the “good guy”
approach (_“We have to save the galaxy! -- Wait, what’s that, old lady? Your
kitten is trapped in this death maze? We’ll help!”_), also did pretty much
every sidequest I could find, landed on every rock available, and ended up
spending -~43- 34 hours or so. Hey, my char even had freaky, slightly awkward
(in the build-up) alien sex with [that endlessly blabbering blueberry][4].
Dynomite.

The second time around I rolled a female (Soldier class) and played the whole
game on hardcore difficulty in a _“I have a job to do, get out of my way”_
kind of way. Short-tempered, gun-in-your-face attitude, not afraid to leave a
crater. In short, for the most part I tried to play it like time actually
mattered. This time I clocked in around 20 14 hours. And this time, my leading
lady ended up ripping the clothes off one of her male subordinates. Oh, and
she had freaky, surprising lesbian alien sex with some random NPC, without
meaning to.

Shiny.

The game’s not without flaws, tho. The sidequests on the planets are a wee bit
repetitive. There are some rather frequent framerate drops and “Halo 2”-style
texture pop-in issues after the loading screens. Background noises were
sometimes awfully quiet, and it was _really, really_ hard to make them out,
which made some surroundings appear a bit sterile in the aural department. The
squad NPC pathfinding took a short break from time to time, making me run back
to show one of my compadres how to walk around the car. Oh, and Bioware? My
wife asks whether for ME2 you could add some more samples to enemy NPCs, I
think if she has to hear _“I will destroy you!”_ or _“Go! Go! Go!”_ one more
time, she’ll be going postal.

But ultimately, in my book, it’s really a great game. Hey, it’s mostly
“Knights of the Old Republic”, albeit with a lot of changes! It might not
perfect, but it comes close. The player char’s gender does make a difference
every now and then. I liked the majority of the voice acting, the stories and
side-quests were mostly laid out well, and the presentation was usually top
notch. Especially the last 1-2 hours were _mighty_ fine. Cinematical, even.
Wonderful, wonderful build up of tension.

All in all I’ve spent around 60-70 50-60 hours on Mass Effect, and enjoyed
those. I recommend it.
