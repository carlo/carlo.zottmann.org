Over the last few years, I have always wondered why there was no site that
would allow me to track my progress in World of Warcraft. Sure, there's the
[WoW Armory][1] and sites like Raptr, but all these places take more of a
"your char right now!" approach which never came close to what I had in mind.
And those that did go into the direction I was thinking didn't _click_ with
me.

But what exactly did I have in mind? This is where it gets a bit complicated.
I was looking for a site that would automatically keep track of my characters
for me, make daily snapshots, let me upload images and notes… Give me a
timeline of their progress… In short, something that would allow me to
_document_ the "life" of my toons. Maybe something that would give me a bit
more, with "more" still being a very diffuse idea.

Anyways, I always felt this was strange there was no such site, as I believe
there's an audience for that. So many people do invest so many hours, so much
energy and money into the game, I can't possibly be the only one wanting.

I ended up firing up TextMate and starting to code, and only a short while
°cough° later, I had something I deemed good enough to release as a beta.

**Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you [CharPool][2].**

The site does exactly what I've described a few paragraphs ago, but it also
throws in (in my opinion) funky Twitter support, whereas you can tweet in the
name of your characters, and these tweets will show up on the chars timeline,
together with your achievements and screenshots etc. It also has feeds.

There's also a page which shows you the WoW-related tweets of your guild mates
and also of the people you are following on CharPool. The guild support is
still rather rudimentary, and at the moment is mostly just a hint at things to
come. Again, it's Twitter-based, because I've read somewhere on AOL that it is
what the "cool cats" are "digging" right now. [^1]

So, I am having plans for CharPool. Big plans. But it's still in its infancy,
there're a few rough edges, and **I'll need testers to take a look, poke
around, and give me feedback**. Preferrably WoW players, because, you see,
without active characters the site is rather pointless. :)

I've opened up _250 beta slots_ which are given away on a "first come, first
serve" basis. I'd appreciate it if you could [take a look][2] if WoW is your
cup o' tea. If not, maybe you know someone who is a player? Then you could
pass him a note.

Thank you very much in advance.
