Long time no notesâ€¦ oh well.

Still no snow outside, just rain rain rain - oh, and fog. When I was a kid it
was white outside the house from mid-November to February. I think it's no
coincidence that the words "climate" and "clusterfuck" both start with the
same letters. The Kyoto climate conference is a nice idea, but as long as the
biggest [cause of pollution][1] isn't interested in it, we continue to be
fucked.

[Scripting News][2]: _"Halley's Comment: [What's a Weblog?][3]"_ - Nice! ("6.
Blogs are one of the last places where you can still tell the truth.")

CNN Europe started to broadcast the [Daily Show with Jon Stewart][4] here in
Germany, and I just love it. Too bad they're only showing a so-called "Global
Edition" once a week instead of the regular one every day.

[Scripting News][2]: _"[Tom Matrullo wonders][5] what Doubleclick sees when
they peer out at us through their Flash-based ads."_ - PLEASE read Tom's blog
entries, especially the 2nd one of the page - seeing that Flash ads/movies are
_theoretically_ able to use my hardware w/o my knowledge is somewhat scary,
ain't it?

MozillaZine - [Mozilla 1.2 - Get It While It's Hot!][6]

And last but not least: Will Ferrell doing some [Switch ads for Apple][7] -
hilarious. I love this guy. :)
