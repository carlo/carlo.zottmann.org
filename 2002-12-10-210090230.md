Actually I sip my coffee yet, because I had a dentist appointment this morning
(nothing big, tho), and my jar still feels like it's not there. Oh well.

On my way to the office I passed a car dealer, specialized in older cars, 70s,
60s, oldtimers and â€¦"veteran tech" (quote from the huge banner on the front
gate). Amazing. Up until now I was convinced that the term "veteran tech"
meant artificial hip joints and pacemakers. Hmm, live and learn, I guess.

Have a great Tuesday, everyone!
