**A DNS validation service that doesn't suck.**  I can recommend [DNSValidation.com](http://www.dnsvalidation.com/), they've served me well.

**Important (videogaming) news.**  [Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/02/14/todays-important-news/) somehow manages to distill the gist from every gaming headline ever into a neat yet funny list.  These people are professionals.

**Backbone Patterns.**  [Rico Sta. Cruz' list of useful Backbone techniques](http://ricostacruz.com/backbone-patterns/) comes in rather handy.  I like his idea [regarding partials](http://ricostacruz.com/backbone-patterns/#partials).  Speaking of Backbone, I'm currently having a good time with Backbone and RequireJS.  (Unit testing's a bit of a bitch, tho, but more on that in a later post.)

**Finding with git.**  [Different ways of using git for searching through your files.](http://anders.janmyr.com/2012/01/finding-with-git.html)  I did not know that!

**Newt 2012**.  I believe (in monsters)!  Yes we can (run for our lives)!  Get the shirt to show your true colors.  From the famosos over at [Sharksplode](http://sharksplode.com/newt-2012/).
