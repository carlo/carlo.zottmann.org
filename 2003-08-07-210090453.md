[…and knowing is half the battle][1]. Man, I haven't laughed that hard in a
while… actually I haven't laughed that hard since I steered my BF1942 jeep
over a cliff while Morn was still sitting in the backseat like Ms. Daisy.
(Needless to say I got out of the car half a second before the wheels lost
contact with the ground, watching it hurl down and explode.)
