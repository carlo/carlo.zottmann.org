![Logo: A Small Orange][1] After giving [Media Temple][2] a go for a few
months regarding hosting this little blog on their much-touted [
plan/platform][3], I’ve decided it’s definitely not worth $20/month for me.

Seriously, it’s just a wee blog, nothing big. In fact, it’s mostly a plain
vanilla Wordpress setup. Nothing special there. And also I don’t get many
visitors, so I was surprised to see the site to awfully slow. What gives? On
top of that is the SSH access responding at glacier speeds at any given time;
very underwhelming, too.

So I’ve packed my things and set up shop at [A Small Orange][4]. It’s small,
it’s (said to be) reliable, and the change has been astounding (to me). It’s
nothing _fancy_ in the sense that they redefine web hosting or anything, they
just host my stuff, and that’s it. Which is fine.

In the end, I pay a 1/4 of what Media Temple cost me, and in return get
something that is more like what I was looking for. At least for the last two
days. ;)

I might keep you updated about the long(er) term experience.

**Update 2007-06-15:** Some small grammatical fixes.
