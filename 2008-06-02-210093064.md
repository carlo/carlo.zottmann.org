[![][1]][2]A week ago, during the day, my left lower back and leg started to
hurt. Each step I made stung, and it didn’t get better. I couldn’t think of
anything I had done; I didn’t fall, trip or twist my leg. I had just run in
the morning.

On Thursday the pain was still there, so I’ve consulted a doctor. She told me
to stop running on asphalt the pavement, because no matter how good the shoes,
the ground in itself is too hard, too solid, too inflexible. So what I’ve
done, in effect, was messing with my joints and cramping up my muscles. I was
given a shot and the task to find a better route for running, preferrably
something like forest roads.

Splendid.

Anyways, it’s Monday now, I haven’t been able to run for a week by now, and
this sucks. I’m sitting around, actually _craving_ to log a few kilometers.
Which feels a bit weird because three months ago I didn’t even think about
running.

Damn.
