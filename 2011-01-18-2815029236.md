I wrote Ephemera a) to learn MacRuby and b) to scratch an itch I had. Since
then the iPad was released, and the itch is gone -- I don't read news on my
Kindle anymore. Still, Ephemera has a good number of users, but even though I
had planned to I simply don't have the time to develop it any further. I don't
feel like abandoning it so **I've decided to release its codebase as COSS
(crappy open source software).**

I sure hope someone else will pick it up and run with it! I'm a bit torn about
"setting it free" like this; on the one hand I had planned to add new features
and fix some of it's bugs but on the other hand I have to face the fact that I
simply don't have enough time in the foreseeable future to pursue those goals.
I hope you, the users, can understand that.

Notes about the source code and its license (WTFPL!) etc. can be found in [the
README][2].
