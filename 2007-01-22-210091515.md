After a good brunch with our good friends Seyhan, Daniela, Manfred and
Hendrik, Dana and I set out to watch [The Fountain][1] today, starring Hugh
Jackman and Rachel Weisz.

Even two hours after leaving the theater I am still stunned and deeply touched
by the movie.

What’s it about? Yes, well, good question. To me, the movie wasn’t much about
a story but about a _feeling_, or better, about _feelings_. The movie emanates
a distinctive sadness, and yet manages to be full of hope; and it is seriously
the first movie that really, really, captured the earnestness of true love.

Not by displaying big budget, singing and dancing and flashy pictures, but by
having everything fit together perfectly: a strange and gripping tale,
seriously great acting, wonderful aurals (it’s not just music) and working,
breathtaking visuals.

I have a hard time describing it, sorry. If there ever was a movie that had
the faintest hint of a _soul_, it must be this one.

It is not for everyone, but we were both awed by it. Seeing it was a gift, at
least to me.
