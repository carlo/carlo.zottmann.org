2-days shopping spree in order to get dressed for next weekend, where two of
our friends are celebrating their wedding.

I just remembered how much I hate buying clothes. It's not that I don't find
anything at all, but I get angry by looking at price tags. A jeans for â‚¬189? A
_jeans_? WTF? Is the part where my package is held laced with platinum? It'd
better be.

Anyways, after visiting the usual suspects (Esprit, H&M, a number of local men
outfitters etc.) I've ended up with a nice combination, new shoes and a few
new pieces of leg plate armor jeans.

I've decided our friends need no gift anymore. I spent roughly half a day
hunting down clothing in order to look good at their wedding weekend, and by
the gods, this must count for something, right? That's the greatest gift of
all, right? :P
