I’m done with the redesign. Both my [tumblelog][1] and this blog now share the
same layout and (the most important parts of the) sidebar, adding some much
needed consistency.

Also I’ve got rid of the Google Coop search and put the [Technorati][2] search
to use instead, it’s good enough in my eyes.

The biggest change in functionality is the switch from the built-in Wordpress
comments system to [Disqus][3], on both my blog and tumblelog. Naturally, I’ve
added a tiny bit of logic to the Wordpress templates so the existing comments
are preserved, displayed, and those entries are still accepting new comments
(assuming the [Comments Timeout plugin][4] allows it). But for new entries,
Disqus is used. I figured if I don’t like it, I can always switch back and
cram the exported Disqus comments back into WP.

Yeah.

Now if I could use Markdown for new posts instead of Textile, I’d be a happy
camper. The [WP Text Control plugin][5] is no help, unless you consider making
the server drop the connection every time helping. I don’t.

Repeated tips of the hat to [Bill Israel][6] for sharing his wonderful
[Letterhead Tumblr theme][7] with the crowds ([CC licensing][8] FTW!). Due to
its beautifully simple semantic structure I was able to transform it into a
Wordpress theme in about two hours. Thanks, Bill!

In somewhat related news: the [Hendromat][9] has launched a new tumbelog last
night—[Make Games, Not Love][10], MGNL for short. Go check it out.
