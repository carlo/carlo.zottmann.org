Abstract: An inflatable church, now I've seen it all.


Good morning everyone. I'm here with the latest from the insanity front:

[The Inflatable Church][1]: _"[..] The worlds one and only inflatable church
is here to allow couples to get married where-ever their heart desires. This
fantastic air filled building is 47ft long by 25ft wide & 47ft high. The
attention to detail is heavenly complete with plastic "stained glass" windows,
airbrush artwork which replicates the traditional church. Inside it has an
inflatable organ, altar, pulpit, pews, candles and a gold cross. Even the
doors are flanked by air-filled angels. The church can be built in three hours
and dis-assembled in less than two. [..]"_ Don't forget to check out [the
video][2].

In movie news: [Fans outraged at new character in Return Of The King.][3]
_"[..] "While The Two Towers is performing better at the box office than The
Fellowship of the Ring, we are worried about a demographic that is skewing
much older than desired. More mature fans are very good to have, but it's the
younger fans who buy the merchandise. That's really what brings in the bucks
on a movie like this," said producer Tim Wilcox. [..]"_ Understandable.

In other news: No personal entry from me lately, because I was way too busy
with playing [Hegemonia: Legions Of Iron][4]. Fun game, nice single player
campaign, the 3D is stunning, the tactics screens are usable, overall a bit
too much micromanagement for my taste, but fun nonetheless. I think I'll write
a short review soon. Oh, and my vacation is over, I'm back in ye olde
treadmill, so that cuts on both gaming and blogging time as well. ;)

Have a good Thursday.
