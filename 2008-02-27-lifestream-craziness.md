So [Friendfeed][1] opened yesterday. Naturally, I had to sign in to take a
look.

When I got to the point where it wanted me to configure the feeds and services
to grab data from, it first asked for my Google Reader shared items. Okay, can
do. Then it asked for my [Tumblr][2] name, and this is where my eyebrows went
down.

So Tumblr allows me to bundle many of my “activities” in one place. Flickr,
blog posts, Twitter posts, links etc., you name it. It does so by querying
your Flickr account, your blog(s), Twitter, your del.icio.us bookmark dump (to
name a few) via their RSS feeds. And I believe many people are using this
feature just for that. I know I do. So that’s usually the first (or even
second) re-posting of original content.

Now lifestream services like Friendfeed come hopping along and are going to
add _another_ level of abstraction, in the form of aggregation of already
aggregated content, or an RSS feed for the aggregated lifestream, or yet
_another_ social network layer, and/or by adding comments on top of that.

How much more meta can we go? This is some Zen shit, man.

I swear, one of these days someone will put yet _another_ layer on this Crazy
Content Cake of Doom and a black hole will open in the middle of the Internet
and suck out all intelligence, reason and original content. (Yes, like Digg,
just a wee bit worse.)

Also, I am well aware that I, too, run [my own version of a lifestream
service][3], and that my post might seem hypocritical, but by the Gods,
there’s a reason why I try to keep [escaloop][3] simple.

**Update:** Added some clarifications.
