Well, [Movember 2011][1] came and went, it's time for one final update.

![Me, beardless][2]

Over the course of the last four weeks I was able to rake in **a total of €301
[^1] going to the [Movember Global Action Plan][4]** benefitting prostate
cancer research and prevention world-wide. **Many thanks to Susi, Mike,
Marcus, Brad, Christian, Hendrik, Alexander, Mario, Dawn and my parents!** You
guys rock.

Also I've actually talked about prostate cancer with a number of people — it's
not necessarily the most awesome topic at a party but it's important
nonetheless. And in the end it's what this drive is all about, innit.

And then there were the updates and the pictures. [Gods, the pictures.][5] I
realized rather quickly why I had decided years ago on going bearded all the
time — I look terribly silly without. Thankfully, my hair knows how to grow,
and my face got some of its manly fur back rather quickly.

The results speak for themselves, I think.

![Quigley, original and fak…hommage][6]

(By the way, did you realize how crazy expensive it is to get Alan Rickman to
(agree to a [Quigley Down Under][7] re-enactment photo shoot? [Should you feel
(like pitching in to help me cover my runaway expenses, be my guest.][8])

In any case, I had fun! The Movember donation box will remain open until Dec
9th, 2011. A big "thank you" to all who participated and chipped in! :D

![Me and my Quigley][9]


[^1]: That's roughly USD 65.000, I believe. ;)
