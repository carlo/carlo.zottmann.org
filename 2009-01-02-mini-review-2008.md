  * I was promoted. Then I lost my job. But I came to a conclusion, and found new goals. (More on this later.)
  * I had planned on [running][1] 250km, then hit that goal in October, and ended up doing 400km.
  * My granny passed away, and I miss her.
  * My faith in the USA was partially restored (the Obama campaign and its success even gave me hope, and I don't even "count").
  * We're done with the bulk of the renovating of our 2nd floor. I've installed the floor tilings. w00t!
  * I was overly surprised by a videogame — GTA IV. I've spent a lot of time on that one. Wonderful adult entertainment.
  * I got me an iPod touch — which turns out to be a good reading device, thanks to both [Instapaper Pro][2] and [Stanza][3].
  * I've tried to bring Child's Play to Germany, and failed. Oh well, it was the first round. Better luck in 2009.
  * I've launched a few smaller projects — [Twitter Twerp Scan][4], escaloop (which I've shut down a few months later) and [Random.li][5].
  * I came to love [GitHub][6]. Great site/service.

### Verdict

  * A really good year.

### Posts

I didn't write as much as I had planned on doing, but nonetheless, here are a
few of my "better" posts (subjective opinion, YMMV).

  * [Revelation, Twitter Edition][7]
  * [Revelation, Garden Store Edition][8]
  * [Der Vogel][9] (in German)
  * [Going Paleolithic][10]
  * [A German’s View: US Elections 2008][11]
  * [Child's Play 2008: Germany][12]
  * [The Amazing Xmas Gift Ideas Machine][13]

Have a good 2009.
