**Right, I remember!** Did I ever blog about being [interviewed][1] (“mentioned” would probably be the better term) by the guys over at the [Yahoo Publisher Network blog][2]? About [Planet Yahoo!][3], of course. Hilarious how I _completely_ forgot about this…

**April 30.** There’ll be an ARG to stimulate the [Collective Intelligence][4] to [deal with the idea of an oil crisis starting end of April][5]. I must say, I love the idea. There is apparently such a huge demand for ARGs, why not use this raw potential to do something _worthwhile_? [World Without Oil][6] aims to do that. Kudos.

**Mac game development.** [via [Hendrik][7]] [Game developers give the Mac another look][8]—this can only be a good thing. Yay!

**Troubled languages.** English is degrading each and every day, [says Glass Maze’s lapsed cannibal][9] in a amusing, yet angry rant.

> I often find myself in meetings where the English language is beaten,
burned, shat upon, drawn-and-quartered, and finally twisted into a monstrous
parody of itself, then slapped onto a powerpoint slide and projected onto a
wall, where its shame and ignominy are visible to all.

And you know what? He might be right, but I believe _blood would come out of
his ears on a daily basis_, if he were a caring German listening to his native
language. Don’t know what I mean? Take what he said, double it, and imagine
parts of any given sentence being peppered with English/German _halfbreeds_
constantly.

I notice that I, personally, see a decline in the quality of _my_ German --
which is my very own tongue, mind you --, due to the fact that I speak English
half of the time for a good number of years by now. I switch between the
languages without effort, sometimes in the middle of a sentence, and -- worst
of all -- interchange English and German words rather frequently. Shame on me.

But the longer I think about it, the more I wonder whether this is a price we
have to pay for globalization… Remember [Blade Runner][10] with his “gutter
speak”? Just thinking out loud.
