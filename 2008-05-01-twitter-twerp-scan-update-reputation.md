Another late night [Twerp Scan][1] coding session. I mean, why not? ;) So,
what’s new today?

  * **User reputation:** You know the people you’re following, right? If you like what they do, give them a thumbs up or down rating. (No registration necessary. Just click.)
  * Some **more pagination options:** If you want, you can see all your contacts at once now.
  * The **table columns can be re-ordered**. Want the verdict right next to the name? Click the column header, hold the mouse button and drag it over.
  * More vertical space. It’s a wide table, after all.

For me, the reputation is a big one. Up until now, there was no way (that I
know of) that allowed for community-driven behaviour rating. Here’s the idea:
we can block the “bad guys” all we want, but if I’d block @buyinsurancelol,
you wouldn’t know. But now I can give the guy a “thumbs down” in Twerp Scan,
and if you have him in your contact list, _you will see_ he’s got a thumbs
down.

On the other hand, if a 100 people think [@MyBlogLog][2] is an okay guy (he
is) and give his Twerp Scan contact list entry a “thumbs up”, you’ll see it in
your contact list (on Twerp Scan)—which might convince you his 1:7 ratio and
his following 15k other people are okay.

Well, at least that’s the idea. It’s a community-driven experiment. So
consider playing around with it for the betterment of interwebs! Since it’s a
pluggable system I think there are other possibilities… For example a
Greasemonkey script that adds the reputation thumbs to the actual Twitter
pages etc. Let’s brainstorm. The comments are open.

Well, that’s it. [Head on over to Twerp Scan to check out the new
features.][1] And please let me know what you think, either via Twitter or the
comments below.

(By the way, big thanks to the [YUI][3] team, the [Yahoo! Pipes][4] and [JS-
Kit][5] for making this endeavour so simple. Appreciate it! Now if there only
was something so simple to make the page less fugly…)
