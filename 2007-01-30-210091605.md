**CSS Well Of Knowledge.** [53 CSS-Techniques You Couldn’t Live Without][1] is a nicely done, dense list of cool techniques (with links).

**Great quote.** [[via][2]]:

> If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide
the work and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and
endless sea.

—[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry][3]

**Minty!** [Mint v2][4]. ‘nuff said.

**Firebug video.** Last week, Joe Hewitt, [Firebug][5] developer, visited the [Sunnyvale campus][6] to give a tech talk about version 1.0. The video of this _very_ interesting session (choke-full of JS dev goodness) is [available now over at YDN][7]. There’s even a downloadable Quicktime version. Go watch.

I’ll now get me my morning coffee. Have a nice day.
