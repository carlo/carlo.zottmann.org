I was made aware that [BetterSearch][1] is currently not working on Google.
Apparently, Google changed the HTML of the results page, and BetterSearch
doesn't know what to do.

I'll release 1.22 _soon_. Stay tuned.

**Update 2008-08-22:** I've just uploaded v1.22 to the Mozilla addon site; once it's been reviewed by the staff there, it should show up [here][2].

**Update 2008-08-24:** v1.22 was [reviewed and approved][2]!
