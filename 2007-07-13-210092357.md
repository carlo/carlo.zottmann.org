I just noticed that when visiting a list of posts for a particular tag, you
could only see the first ten entries for that tag, but you couldn’t flip to
the next page—the “Next Page” links were broken. Brilliant.

I just fixed it, so lists like [everything OpenID, page #2][1] works now.

   [1]: /tag/openid/page/2/
