**1080p!!!1** I don’t know whether technically [this qualifies as joke][1], but I laughed.

**Re-roll.** [Kind of sad][2], but I’m in pretty much the same spot. Sans the couch.

**Wikipedia.** xkcd nails [the problem with Wikipedia][3].

**Buzz donuts.** [via [JR][4]] [Scientist develops caffeinated doughnuts][5]. Oh yes. Each donuts contains the caffeine of approximately two cups of coffee.
