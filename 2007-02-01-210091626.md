Today is the day Vista is launched by [many happy faces at Microsoft][1]. (The
World stood still for a _very short_ moment… it blinked, shrugged, and
continued to spin, feeling indifferent.)

Today is the day I placed an order for [a new machine][2]. It will be big, and
I will be very happy the day it’ll arrive—this Friday, if all goes well.

No real connection between these two _fantastic_ events. By the way, one of
them excites me to a degree I can’t really communicate, the other… eh… not so
much.
