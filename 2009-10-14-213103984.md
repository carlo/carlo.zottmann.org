Just a heads-up: I've moved my blog today — in two ways. First, I've ditched
my self-hosted Wordpress setup in favor of [Tumblr][1]. Because I ♥
Tumblr. [^1] Second, it's now sitting on [blog.zottmann.org][3] instead of
[carlo.zottmann.org][4]. Old article URLs 301-redirect to their new locations,
so all should be well.

Also, I've cleaned up the blog history; about 2/3 of the old posts are gone.
Most of them either simply lost their context, contained nothing but (now)
broken links or are not worth keeping online. Doing my part to keep the
intertrons lean!

The move was made possible by Wordpress' export-to-XML feature, the [Tumblr
API][5] and [a few lines on Ruby code][6]. (The latter is a big hack job, but
it works for me. You've been warned.)

And to top it of, I've picked a new [Tumblr theme named "PostCreate"][7] and
hacked it to my liking.

I'm pleased so far. :)
