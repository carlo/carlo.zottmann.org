It's great, get it now.

(If you don't believe me right away, then take a look at the [Between
Interval][1] site. There you can listen to the _whole album_ for free; that's
right, 75 minutes of ambient pleasure for your ears. Doesn't cost you
anything. Nothing, nada, bupkis. Then, if you like it (and if you, like me,
like a healthy dose of ambient music, you'll love it), you can buy it as DRM-
free, high-quality MP3 files for â‚¬5.99.)

Seriously. Get it now.

_Update:_ I wasn't totally clear -- the site itself only offers excerpts. But
once you visit [the store page][2], you'll find the full tracks in preview
quality.
