Gots me one of them Wiis the other day. Got Monkeyball and Rayman, but always
ended up playing [Wii Sports][1] with Dana _for hours_ so far—mostly Bowling
and Golf. It’s surprisingly, insanely fun. Really well done. The fact that she
likes the Bowling game so much alone was well worth the price.

I am sporadically online, if you want my Wii code, drop me a line, you know
how to reach me.

Oh, and if you have a Mac, I believe you’ll want [this][2].
