I’ve spent the last few hours bug testing, then deploying, then yelling at,
then hotfixing, then re-deploying a new version of [both escaloop site and
badge][1]. I didn’t include everything I was planning on initially, and
instead decided to go for _“release early, release often”_.

A few highlights:

  * Added some juice and stability—hopefully everything runs a bit faster more solid now.
  * New feature: Source list, add a pretty list of all feeds in a badge to the end of the badge. Check [the demo badge][2] for an example and the [badge builder][3] for the new config option.
  * Badge: added explicit support for Facebook, Digg, Newsvine and Vimeo feeds.
  * Badge: Changes in served badge JS and CSS; if you use local hacks, take a closer look at your escaloop-served “originals”.
  * Site: Restructured the site a bit.
  * Site: Added exhaustive workflow diagram to frontpage.
  * Site: Fix: Preview pages not cached anymore.

I hope you’ll like it. If you find bugs or have questions, [let me know on the
message boards, please!][4] I’m all ears.
