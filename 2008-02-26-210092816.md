It’s amazing what 30 minutes of frantic walking can do for your sanity.
Tonight, when getting out of the subway and noticing my bus had just left,
I’ve popped in a 131bpm [Podrunner][1] mix and started walking. A good 30
minutes later I found myself on my doorstep with a clear head.

Check out [Podrunner][1], a free weekly podcast of one hour gapless music
mixes for workouts and the likes. The only trick is to find a bpm range that
suits you. Then put it on your iPod.

It’s simply _that_ good.

Nerdy pro tip: once you’ve found your bpm range, build a [Pipe][2] like [I
did][3] and subscribe to this feed instead of the [original one][4] to only
get podcasts which are “suited” for you. Oiy!
