Feel a cold coming, I think… well, I feel it for two weeks by now, so no
surprise there.

The weekend at my parents was pretty cool, my mom loved the Playstation 2 she
got as a birthday present from my sis, my dad and us. Dana's mom shelled out
the money for her beloved SSX game, so my mother was just jumping up and down.
:) Took quite some time to get back to Munich afterwards because the first bad
fall storms were sweeping the land yesterday… we made it back unharmed, tho,
but the drive took more energy than usual (especially Dana, who was driving
4/5 of the distance).

Gonna call the garage today.
