_This post references [MacRuby][1] 0.5b2, used with Xcode 3.2 on Snopard
(10.6.2)._

At some point you'll probably want to create a release build for your app.
You'd like to compile it and embed the MacRuby framework so the app is self-
contained. Cool beans.

Unfortunately, it's not as easy as it seems. Yes, the MacRuby Xcode template
contains both an "Embed" and a "Compile" target, and they _seem_ to work fine.
;) The problem I ran into, though, was that whenever you would `require`
anything from the Ruby standard library (say, `yaml` or `stringio`), the app
would forget about the embedded version of MR and look for
`/Library/Frameworks/MacRuby.framework/â€¦`.

I didn't notice this at first since this folder exists on my dev machine (big
surprise), but when I tested it on a clean machine (i.e. one where MacRuby
isn't installed), nothing would happen. Well, nothing except some lines in the
system.log, that is:

Being a newb to the ancient arts of compiling shit self-written software I was
scratching my head rather furiously. It took me several hours of digging
around the Googles and [macruby-devel][2] to learn about `install_name_tool`,
and how it's used to adjust the path of a shared library inside a file.

And that's what I did, then. I've created a new build target, "Embed and
Compile", which has two sub-targets:

  1. the reference to the default app build phase (which means "MyNewApp" is a direct dependency of the "Embed and Compile" target)
  2. a "Run Script" build phase named "Embed, Compile, Fix"

The script runs `macruby_deploy` and afterwards tells `install_name_tool` to
do its dirty, dirty work. I found it's not enough to have it adjust the
executable only; for me it was necessary to fix all the `*.rbo` files as well.

So, that's it. The above works for me, it might work for you as well. If you
have comments, suggestions or recommendations, _please_ sound off below. I'm
still learning all of this, and any input is appreciated. :)

Oh, and in case I sound ungrateful or anything: I am not. MacRuby 0.5b2 is
exactly what is says it is: the second beta of a software's pre-1.0 version.
It's already pretty damn impressive but not really done yet. I had a hunch
what I was getting into, so it's cool. ;)
