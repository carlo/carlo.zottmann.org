…in Europe. According to the [Internet Traffic Report][1], Europe’s intertubes
currently feature around 20-30% packet loss. _Average_, I might add. It seems
like two of three major German routers have fallen of the net.

I can indeed confirm this: My connection graph looks like a comb.

When calling my ISP I don’t even get to the “on hold” loop, the automaton on
the other end is telling me _“Everyone’s busy, please leave a name and number,
we’ll call you back ASAP”_. Usually there’s a person answering after three
rings max.

Please, dear Intertron, get unbroken again. We’ll be good kids, I swear.
