I am amazed how on some days a song can make you grin like an idiot and _even
boost your confidence_, while on other days the same song doesnâ€™t do anything.

The human mind contains strange mechanics and some weird code.

By the way, the song triggering this musing was [_Captain Sensual_ by Groove
Armada][1].
