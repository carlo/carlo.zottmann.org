It just dawned me that on the web, Germany must be to the UK and US what China
is to the rest of the “real” World (at least in the perception of the rich
western countries): copycats.

Cases in point: [Frazr][1] vs. [Twitter][2], [StudiVZ][3] vs. [Facebook][4], a
dozen del.icio.us clones vs. [del.icio.us][5].

Seriously, the (visible part of the) German startup scene is making a _sad_
impression. Pretty much each new German site I see is more or less a carbon
copy of a successful UK or US site. The other day I was even approached
whether I wanted to help clone [Pownce][6] (_“Hey, how quickly could one copy
a site like that?”_). What happened to ingenuity and/or integrity?

I really start to believe I know [the only original guy around][7].
