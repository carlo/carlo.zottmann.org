Really nice article in the Guardian's Environment section today:
[A small town in Germany where recycling pays](http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/mar/18/recycling-waste)

That's the second Guardian article I've read in the last few weeks that deals
with the German recycling system/culture.  I find them interesting not because
they're news to me but because they pose an outsider's view, written to
explain the benefits to an interested (?) outside audience.  The system works,
it's nothing we think about anymore.

On a related note: here in Munich, bringing waste to the recycling depot is
actually _free_ to Munich residents.
