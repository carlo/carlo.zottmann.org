**The 3 Laws.** Watched [I, Robot][1] on DVD last night, good movie. Action movie, yes, but with good characters and a good story. And hey, [Alan Tudyk][2]!

**Jackman vs. Bale.** We had the pleasure of watching [The Prestige][3] in the theater today, and it was worth both time and money. A great flick about obsession, go see it.

PS: I am very proud about the pun in the subject.
