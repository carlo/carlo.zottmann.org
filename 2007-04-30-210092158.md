After many hours in the lab, spent on creating timelines and elaborate flow
charts, I am proud to present you, World, my “Evolution of Digg.com”. I’ve
manage to condense it into a few short lines, too:

> Late 2004, Digg.com created > “a fun site!” > gains momentum, becomes useful
> single spammers appear, some fools, too > OMG it’s spammed, lots of fools >
unbearable > totally useless > PRESENT DAY.

Don’t go there unless you feel like clawing your eyes out after being
confronted with utter stupidity. If you actually _do_ feel like, pick any
thread.

That is all.
