![Yahoo! Pipes logo][1]**Swinging big.** [Yahoo! Pipes][2] is live! Go play
around with it. It’s really good stuff with almost limitless possibilities. I
didn’t work on it personally, and I’m speaking from an end-user perspective.
[Jeremy Zawodny][3], [Tim O’Reilly][4] and [Ed Ho][5] (one of the Pipes
developers) described the product in detail earlier today already, so go read.
And play. Have fun! Awesome job, esteemed colleagues.

**And now the weather.** Quote of the day [via [Beryl][6]]:

> You know it’s cold out when teenagers actually wear coats.

**Chair folding.** [Interesting video][7]. I see real practical use for a product like this. Not for everyday, of course, but every now and then…

**Sociality.** I am aware that this is not a valid word, but then again, [this is not really a valid page either][8]. Hey, I had to put it _somewhere_…

**getYear().** [getYear. No, not that year!][9] is a funny list of bad Javascript getYear() practices. Stuff like that is both awful and funny:

`var year=RightNow.getYear(); if (year==106){year="2006";}`
