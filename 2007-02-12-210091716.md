**Quote of the moment.** [Simon][1] on SEO, SMO and TLA’s:

> SMO, or "Social Media Optimisation" — digg spamming now has its own TLA.

**Real life recursiveness.** [Best warning sign EVER.][2] A sign warning about itself. Classic _“WTF?”_ moment. This is deep.

**On Mistakes.** Glass Maze: [Mistakes were made][3]—an angry, yet polite, essay on political semantics.

> So if a guy’s ever caught cheating on his wife, say, he could tell her:
“Yes, intercourse with someone other than you may have taken place.
Ejaculation could have resulted. And I take full responsibility for this
unfortunate set of circumstances, as they occurred under my watch.”

**Text on the web.** [The Onion nails what’s wrong with most text on the web][4], even though they aren’t even trying. The image itself is pretty funny, but it’s a good metaphor also.
