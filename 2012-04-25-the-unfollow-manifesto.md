Title: The Unfollow Manifesto
Abstract: Ssssh, it's okay.  It's not an insult.

At some point in the past I've decided to follow you on Twitter or any other social network, because you appeared to be a person whose postings I might be interested in.

But recently you've noticed me unfollowing you.

Now you're confused/sad/angry.  Don't be.  I am just following my three simple rules.

1. You may unfollow me at any given time, because what I post might not be your cup of tea.  It's okay, no hard feelings.  I won't take that as an insult.  (Really.)  I assume we're still cool outside said service, unless of course I wrote some horrible shit that offended you, in which case I am probably sorry.

2. I may unfollow you at any given time, because what you post might not be my cup of tea.  It's okay, tho.  You shouldn't take that as an insult.  (Really.)  You can assume we're still cool outside said service, unless of course you wrote some horrible shit that offended me, in which case you can probably go fuck yourself.

3. If you take my unfollowing you as an insult, that's your problem, not mine.  (Really.)
