A post on the [MobileRead forums][1] hinted at my [Cybook Gen3][2] stability
issues being related to the font face used for displaying text, so I've
replaced the very lovely [Liberation Serif][3] with the slightly less lovely,
but nonetheless enjoyable [DejaVu Condensed Serif][4].

Lo and behold, the stability improved tremendously â€” my Cybook hasn't crashed
once since I've switched.

So, yes, the crashes/lockups are definitely font issues. The more you know.
