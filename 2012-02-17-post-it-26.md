**Sublime Text 2 has quickly become my default text editor**, and it's great that you can enhance it with some select packages.  My favourites so far are [Sublime Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) (great starting point!), [sublime-jshint](https://github.com/uipoet/sublime-jshint), [Gist](https://github.com/condemil/Gist) and [SideBarEnhancements](https://github.com/titoBouzout/SideBarEnhancements).

**Allrounder devices FTW!**  TechBlock's editorial ["Samsungâ€™s super-sized Galaxy Note changed my life"](http://www.thetechblock.com/articles/2012/samsungs-super-sized-galaxy-note-changed-my-life/) is rather in-depth.  Beautiful photography, too.

**Gumroad is really, really, really simple way to sell links.**  As in: you have something you want to sell (link/picture/file), you want to accept credit cards, and you want to get it done in under 10 minutes.  (Like, oh I don't know, [a picture of me saluting you.](https://gumroad.com/l/DBDe))  Its simplicity is great but due to the absence of an API there's no way to create links programmatically.  Still: selling something won't get much simpler than this.

**Coffee is helping.**  Mackenzie Sheppard's short documentary [Yoshi's Blend](http://www.theatlantic.com/video/print/2012/02/one-mans-quest-to-bring-good-coffee-and-hope-to-japans-tsunami-zone/252592/) is really touching.

> After the earthquake and tsunami, Yoshi Masuda set out to share his love of coffee and vintage gramophone tunes with survivors, driving across Japan in a VW bus and setting up outposts of the HOPE Cafe. His humble goal is to create a scene of normalcy and warmth in a devastated area.

It's just over 8 minutes long, so take a quick break and go for it.
