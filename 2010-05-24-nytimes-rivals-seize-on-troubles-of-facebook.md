Interesting article in the [NYTimes: Rivals Seize on Troubles of Facebook][1].

Ultimately, I doubt there'll be enough momentum for any of these sites to
_really_ take off. And yes, I say that despite me backing Diaspora*. But I
believe they will fail to attract a serious following because in the end, you
go where your people are, and they're not _there_ yet. Herd mentality meets
chicken & egg.

I—as an end user—would need to decide whether my jumping ship @ FB is more
important than loosing the "posse" I've built there during the time I've used
the site. And I think for most people the answer would be "no".

That being said, I approve of all of these efforts to build some much needed
competition for the four thousand million pound gorilla that is Facebook. The
prospect of having a portable profile (see [Diaspora*][2] for more info) is
exciting, but while I hope that their plans come to fruition (especially their
hosted service) I remain skeptical.
