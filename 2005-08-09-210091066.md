Title: Translators needed

I need some translators for [BetterSearch][1], since the upcoming version 1.9
will introduce localization.

I have English, German, Italian and Catalan language files so far; I'm looking
for French, Spanish and everything else at the moment. The translation process
is rather simple, you'd have to edit two text files and replace English
phrases with ones in your language. :)

If you want to know more, [take a look, please][2].

Thanks!
