The other day I had to move my desk to another room, and thus was cut off more or less entirely from the rest of the Y! engineering gang.  My homies, my posse, noone around!  _Mein Leben!_

Anyways, during the day I was chatting with [Mike][2], who didn't have to move from the other room (because he is cool). _“How you holding up?”_, he asked. _“Okay, but I’m lonely… SEND HELP”_, I said.  And then promptly forgot about the whole thing.

Fast forward three days.

An innocent-looking Amazon package is lying on my desk. Contents: a CD — _“Help”_ by _The Beatles_.

![Beatles, Help][1]

Mike, you jackass. :)
