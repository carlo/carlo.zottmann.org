Huh, a few months since my last post, eh? Bummer. Time flies when you're
having fun or when you're busy. Or both.

Since I've joined Yahoo! Germany in October the size of my brain has increased
a bit, I think. Awesome company. My abilities are useful here, and I'm
learning quite a bit, which is a great combination in my book. I feel welcome.
During the (rather lengthy) interview process I've had the feeling they are
actually interested in my personality; turns out I was right -- I was in fact
tested for "group compatibility". (Testing social skills might seem like a no-
brainer, but sadly, in many companies, it isn't…) This resulted in a TTI (time
to integration;)) of less than two weeks, meaning after two weeks I didn't
feel like the new guy anymore. Very cool.

As mentioned, the job is fun. Lots of work, of course, bugs to fix, new
products to launch, things to take care of… I had forgotten how fast a day can
go by, hehe.

Then there's the mailing lists. Don't get me wrong, I think there is, in fact,
such a thing as "too much mail". But on the other hand a company with employee
gaming mailing lists where people discuss WoW gold farming can't be bad, now
can it. :P

And… boy, I've seen things. Interesting projects in the works here. No, can't
and won't tell, sorry. :)

So, to make it short, I'm happy, for my work life is finally good again.

That is all. Commence doing your thing.
