Alright, let's pick up [my old 2007 habit](http://carlo.zottmann.org/tag/post-it.html) again of collecting interesting links in a quick post.

**Quinn Norton's three part series on Anonymous**' past and present in WIRED is rather good and very well worth the read:

* [Anonymous 101 (1): Introduction to the Lulz](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/11/anonymous-101/all/1)
* [Anonymous 101 (2): Morals Triumph Over Lulz](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/12/anonymous-101-part-deux/all/1)
* [Anonymous 101 (3): 2011: The Year Anonymous Took On Cops, Dictators and Existential Dread](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2012/01/anonymous-dicators-existential-dread/all/1)

**[DocumentUp](http://documentup.com/)**  "Automatically generated documentation sites for your markdown files!"  Nice idea, very well executed.  Kudos!

**That's not quite correct.**  I believe I found [a minor issue with TweetBot's translation service](https://img.skitch.com/20120209-fjye91q6e76ue3s56bii8cacxi.jpg).

**I don't always switch between Ruby versions,** but when I do, I use [Hendrik's rbfu](https://github.com/hmans/rbfu).  It's a tiny, lightweight, sane alternative to rvm and rbenv.  It even supports auto-switching to a particular Ruby version depending on your current folder.  Handy!  (As [I'm not a fan of rvm](http://carlo.zottmann.org/2011/05/26/a-few-notes-about-chef-ubuntu-10-04-ruby-1-9-2/) anymore.)

**[The Death and Return of Superman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PlwDbSYicM)** is amusing for all the uncredited cameos (Simon Pegg, Elijah Wood, Mandy Moore etc.) and the overall insanity -- and I say that as someone who doesn't care about Superman at all.  Via lots of people.
