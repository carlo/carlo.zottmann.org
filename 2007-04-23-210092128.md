Huh, so [I’ve been tagged by Frank][1]. Splendid. :P

I’ve used to read quite a few magazines in the day, mostly to feed my habit
(PC gaming, back then); a remnant of happy times past, when I was a kid. You
see, I grew up in Eastern Germany, and while I had no problems or real
shortcomings there, I never really had the chance to buy computer magazines of
any sort (programming, gaming etc.)—simply because _there were none_.

Well, then one happy day, friends of my parents from Western Germany visited
us, and lo and behold, they brought a few dozen (slightly outdated) computing
magazines, just for me.

Needless to say, a great day in my life.

But with the advent of the Intertron I retreated more and more from reading
paper magazine, mostly because they’re too slow. And also have horrible search
facilities. Plus the links don’t work, or even worse, _there are none_.

Still, I read some magazines. Not many, just a very few. Mostly on the
weekends, because it’s so much cooler to read while lying in a hammock, and
let’s face it, a laptop in a hammock just doesn’t cut it.

So, what do I read these days?

  * [Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin][2]—great little publication, comes with the SZ Friday issue. It may sound silly, but I really fell for that one. I consider it one of my weekly weekend highlights, because I thorougly enjoy it.
  * [The Escapist][3]—a weekly _free_ magazine about gaming culture. Not about reviews and previews and what’s hot etc, mind you. The magazine approaches gaming on a more psychological, human, laid-back level. Each issue has a particular topic, and you can read it either on the web or print it out (beautiful PDF version!) and read it on the subway. Which I do every now and then. Quite frankly, it’s a magazine so good I would actually buy it. Or subscribe to it.
  * I stopped reading [PM Magazin][4] a short while ago, after getting it monthly for a few years. Somehow it doesn’t click with me anymore. Someone once described it to me as _“Bunte für Intellektuelle”_, which I found funny, while at the same time think it’s slightly incorrect.

Well, that’s it. I toss the topic on to [Hendrik][5], [Mike][6], [jeck][7],
[Zhaneel][8], [Beryl][9] and - as an experiment - [the funky folks at
Antigames.de][10]. Go!
