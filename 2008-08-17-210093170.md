I've updated [BetterSearch][1], my Firefox/Flock addon, to [version 1.21][2].
Here's what's new:

  * Compatible with Flock 2 beta+.
  * FIX: Action icons are back.
  * FIX: Delicious support unbroken! It's glorious.
  * FIX: MSN/Live support works again.
  * FIX: Statusbar tooltip was showing the wrong version number. Silly thing.
  * FIX: Made some minor enhancements to Google URL normalisation.
  * FIX: Removed remnant code ("big icons" etc.).
  * CHG: Removed support for everything but Yahoo!, Google, MSN and Delicious. Sorry, don't have the time anymore to keep track of anything else.

Go get [the new version][2] while it's still hot! :)
