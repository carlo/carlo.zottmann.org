Love this song: [Linkin Park, ‘Leave out all the rest’ from their album
‘Minutes to Midnight’][1]. I am in a pretty good mood, even if the text would
suggest otherwise. ;) I don’t know, it just strikes a chord with me.

> I dreamed I was missing, you were so scared But no one would listen, ‘cause
no one else cared After my dreaming, I woke with this fear: What am I leaving
when I am done here?

>

> So if you’re asking me, I want you to know….

>

> When my time comes, forget the wrong that I’ve done Help me leave behind
some reasons to be missed And don’t resent me, when you’re feeling empty Keep
me in your memory, leave out all the rest Leave out all the rest

>

> Don’t be afraid I’ve taken my beating, I’ve shared what I’ve made I’m strong
on the surface, not all the way through I’ve never been perfect, but neither
have you

>

> So if you’re asking me, I want you to know….

>

> When my time comes, forget the wrong that I’ve done Help me leave behind
some reasons to be missed Don’t resent me, and when you’re feeling empty Keep
me in your memory, leave out all the rest Leave out all the rest

>

> Forgetting all the hurt inside you’ve learned to hide so well Pretending
someone else can come and save me from myself I can’t be who you are

>

> When my time comes, forget the wrong that I’ve done Help me leave behind
some reasons to be missed Don’t resent me, and when you’re feeling empty Keep
me in your memory, leave out all the rest Leave out all the rest…

someone else can come and save me from myself I can’t be who you are

By the way, the album is excellent.
