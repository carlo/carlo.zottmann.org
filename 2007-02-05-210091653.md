Okay, so the subject is a bit misleading. The thing is, see, I made this claim
about [Penny Arcade][1] over at [Jyte][2], and it seems like nobody really
agrees. Which makes me sad. Look:

Right now the score is 1 pro, 3 contra—I don’t like that. Go vote. If you have
an [OpenID][3]. If not, [get one][4] (it’s free anyways), then vote.
