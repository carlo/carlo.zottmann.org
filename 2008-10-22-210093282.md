The short story is: not going to happen.

I'll be shutting escaloop down in about a month or so. It was a nice toy and a
fun experiment, I've used it to get into [Ramaze][1], but I have neither the
time nor the energy to work on it any further.

I recommend moving over to [FriendFeed][2] or [Lifestream.fm][3] for all your
lifestream needs. I am sure there are many more such services, just look
around. :)

If you should choose FriendFeed, [look me up if you want][4].
