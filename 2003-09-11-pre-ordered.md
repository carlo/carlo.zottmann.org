Thank you for shopping at Amazon.co.uk!

It's a pleasure. The silly thing about the above pre-order is that if I'd pre-
order it @ amazon.de, it'd be more expensive even tho there'd be no shipping
costs. So the sale goes to the UK, I get the game faster (it's supposed to be
out end of October in Germany), and I get the english version. Yeehaw.
