Pure elegance:

`print [self.entries[a] for a in range(len(self.entries)) if (viewingUser ==
self or not self.entries[a].isPrivate)]`

and

`print [entry for entry in self.entries if (viewingUser == self or not
entry.isPrivate)]`

Built-in privacy on data model level. Live and learn. I love this language.

I want to thank Morn for the nice pun I used as title.

**Update:** Teh Mornster has flexed his mighty Python-Fu by showing me an easier way (second line). I remember starting out like this, but something didn't work, so I tried another way (first line) which worked good. His idea is more elegant, tho. Thanks!
