![Beatles, Help][1]The other day I had to move my desk to another room, and
thus I was cut off completely from the rest of the engineering gang. My
homies, my posse, not in my view anymore! _Mein Leben!_

Anyways, I was chatting with [Mike][2], who didn't have to move from the other
room. _“How you holding up?”_, he asked. _“Okay, but I’m lonely… SEND HELP”_,
I answered.  And then forgot about the whole thing.

Fast forward three days.

An innocent Amazon package is lying on my desk. Inside: a CD—_“Help”_ by _The
Beatles_.

Mike, you jackass. :)
