**Ever played flOw?** Then you might be able to [relate][1].

**Clown car.** [Seriously, it’s not.][2] (The image is safe for work, the type of humor might not be.) Haven’t laughed that much in a while.

**The Daily Show.** My favourite TV show, [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart][3], is part of the program of the [new German Comedy Central][4]. Now here’s the kicker—you can watch every new episode [on their website][5]. Let me sum that up, because it’s so fantastic: Daily Show – most recent ep – streamed – legally – _free_. [Awesome!][5]
