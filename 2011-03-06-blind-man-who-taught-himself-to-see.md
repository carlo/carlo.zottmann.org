["Men’s Journal » The Blind Man Who Taught Himself To See"](http://www.mensjournal.com/the-blind-man-who-taught-himself-to-see/print/):
A terrific, stunning article about Daniel Kish, a blind man who has mastered
echolocation to live his life autonomously.

Like most people, I don't know many blind people.  There were none in my
neighborhood, there still aren't even though my neighborhood has changed a few
times in the last two decades.  Here in Munich you see a good number of white
canes (as in any other bigger city), but I do my best to not treat blind or
handicapped people any differently.  Why would I?  They are just other people,
living their own lives, they're not helpless victims.  If they need help with
anything, they'll probably ask.

Actually, up until a few years ago, I merely tried to ignore them, tried not
to stare, out of fear to misstep — the usual behavior, I'd say.  That changed
for the better when I was working at Yahoo!.  There was a London-based
engineer, [Artur Ortega](http://twitter.com/DesignedByBlind) (really nice guy,
BTW), who one day came to our office to tell us a bit about the way blind
users navigate the net.  He showed us his setup (laptop, screenreader etc.),
and those few hours *really* were a eye-opening experience for me.  (Pun not
intended.)

I've learned a lot about accessibility that day, but also about seeing with
your ears.  His screenreader was yelling at us while he hopped around websites
and his machine, and holy shit, that thing talks fast.  And I mean short-
incomprehensible-burst-of-vaguely-speech-like-static fast.  And Artur stood
there, in the middle of it all, grinning and working and explaining.  Combine
that with the fact that he is constantly traveling around different Y! offices
all over the World for talks and work, and all of a sudden it finally hit me.

He's just another guy doing his job.  Yeah, so blind people can't see with
their eyes.  Big deal.  If it's awkward, then it's mostly awkward for us, the
sighted people.  Because frankly, most of us have no fucking clue how to
approach a person who's blind or deaf or different in the first place, because
we were never trained for that.  Political correctness isn't always helpful
either.  (_"Is it 'blind'?  Can I say that?  Or is it 'visually impaired'?
Damn, I don't want to say anything wrong!  Forget it, I just walk away, maybe
he didn't see me…  OMG, what, no!  I'm a bad person, what is wrong with me?"_
etc.  It may sound funny if I say it like that, but really, it isn't.)

Anyhow.  Great article, go read.  It just reminded me again of Artur and that
one afternoon, even though we didn't speak much a since then, and I felt like
scribbling it down real quick.

Being blind means just another way of living your daily life, I guess.
Nothing else.  I briefly met other blind people since then, and they all
appeared to be rather confident, which makes sense.  Absolutely no need to
feel pity.  Different people, different stories.
