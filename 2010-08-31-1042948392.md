I like [YUIDoc][1]. I don't like its default theme. Since I couldn't find any
other themes on them internets, I wrote [my own, named "Dana"][2].

Since I normally use YUIDoc to document either pure Javascript or jQuery
code [^1], I didn't keep any of the old YUI code; I've ditched pretty much
everything and started from scratch. And this is what I've come up with:

![Screenshot of one of YUI's many many classes][4]

As you can see in the screenshot, as an example I've generated the well-known
YUI API docs. So here's the original YUI documentation in its [original
look][5] — and here is the very same documentation sporting the new [Dana
theme][6].

I hope you find the latter more pleasing just as I do. :) Click around a bit;
check some of the class documentations for a more in-depth comparison; play
with the filters; feel the luxurious yet cheap plastic underneath.

This is a work in progress. It's reasonably stable and working for me so far.
YMMV. If you encounter errors, please [create a ticket][7].

**You'll find "Dana" on [GitHub][2]. If you're so inclined, you can dowload
the [latest stable release as zip/tgz file][8], too.**

Dual-license, MIT & GNU GPL v2. Tested in Safari 5 (OSX), FF3.6 (OSX), IE8
(WinXP).

**UPDATE:** the good folks at YUIblog.com asked me whether I wanted to write
a post about Dana. [I wanted to.][9]


[^1]: Why yes, YUIDoc works just fine for non-YUI JS code. [↩][10]
