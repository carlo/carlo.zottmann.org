So, let's see…

DING -- [Graun][1] reached season 50!

Then I've had a very nice conversation with a human priest or warrior (?)
named Ptalaphose about the future of the Alliance.

I met a friendly Night Elf priest named Avaa which in Felwood. Our paths
happened to cross a few times again. A overly pleasant lass. She invited me to
run a few [Zul'Farrak][2] errands together with her and a few of her friends.
We had a blast. It was a very nice group, two lvl60, two Gahz'rilla Scale
Armor. Lucky me.

Oh, and I've even travelled to [Aldrassil][3] and bribed a few younglings to
help me start [my own guild][4]. Which already has another member, an aspiring
young Elven druid named Yule.

Later on I've convinced those tunnel-dwelling Furbolgs to let me pass from
Felwood to Winterspring and Moonglade. Ah, Moonglade… I've never been there,
can you imagine? I'm playing almost since release day, and I had no idea.

All in all it was a rather nice WoW weekend. Lots of casual and even a bit of
not-so-casual roleplaying. It's amazing how much difference well-formed
sentences and in-character conversations can make. That's why I love Argent
Dawn.

It's quite nice to have the feeling of not being surrounded by 12-year-olds
(_"OMGLOLZRUGAYWTF"_) --- unless the Blackrock server goes down again and
Ironforge is overrun by profane Gnome warriors. Which reminds me: I've
reported about a dozen of those since they were making quite a ruckus on
Saturday, heavily spamming the chat channels, yelling profanities, cussing at
Argent Dawn citizens. Less than 12 hours later I've got an email from Blizzard
support: they are taking actions against those players. Now that's nice, isn't
it? Apparently I wasn't the only one the kids've ticked off. I've no problems
with PvP people using RP servers, for PvP is an integral part of the game, but
people with the clear intention of gameplay disruption need punishment.

Anyways… if you happen to run around on Argent Dawn, drop me a line some time,
I'd appreciate it. Also, if you're unaffiliated and like cunning head wear,
the [Fancy Hat Brigade][4] will be there for you.

(That probably sounds like I've done nothing but playing WoW the whole
weekend, but interestingly enough, that wasn't the case.)
