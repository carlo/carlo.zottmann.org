**Bloody useful.**  [Dev HTTP Client](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm) is a Google Chrome extension to _"[e]asily construct custom HTTP requests, save them permanently, take advantage of variables and contexts."_  Comes with lots of neat features such as response syntax highlighting (HTML/XML/JSON) and image previews.

**Calepin is closing shop.**  The blogging service I use for this here blog is called [Calepin](http://calepin.co/), and I like it a lot (as [mentioned before](http://carlo.zottmann.org/2012/01/20/the-big-blog-move-of-2012/)).  Unfortunately, Jökull can no longer maintain it and so decided [to close shop in June](http://twitter.com/calepinapp/status/192335906479415296).  He [open-sourced the project](http://github.com/jokull/calepin), tho.  If anyone wants to pick it up…

Being no stranger to the blogging game, I know all of my options, but I gotta say, Calepin's concept (single files in Dropbox + push-button publishing via the website) really appealed to me more than the everything-in-Github-and-publish-via-Terminal way.  I'd switch to Calepin-contender [Scriptogram](http://scriptogr.am/) in an instant if they would allow for more flexibility in their blogs' URL paths.

**Better not use the word "book" there, pal.**  In the name of your new project, and if you're a Facebook user, that is.  As [Ars reported a month ago](http://j.mp/I0Skpr), if you're a FB user, you've agreed on a legally binding contract that prevents you from using several words in your own, non-FB projects.  Nice to see they're staying in character.

**Fukken shoelaces, how do they work?**  There's more than one way to tie a knot.  I own some shoelaces that come undone rather easily (due to their teflon-like surface material), but tying them using the [Ian Knot](http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm) helps.

**Hardcore l33t farming.**  Today's extreme e-sports video (spoof) is delightful.
