Everytime I think I've seen it all, I open another PHP script of that one
special co-worker of mine and find myself staring in painful amazement as I
read thru the schizophrenic gibberish that is his code. No real structure,
fucked-up yet working hacks built upon older fucked-up yet working hacks, no
abstraction at all, and a mess in the first place.

The irony is that in order to rewrite the application (that's what I'm trying
to do at the moment) I have to understand what the old code does. Oh, the
pain. Days like this one make me wish I was a bagman or a goat.
