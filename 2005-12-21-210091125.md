Morn and myself were thinking about starting a small, casual, for-fun Tauren
guild on Argent Dawn EU, which is a nice, laid back RP server. There are a few
G-Bloggers on AD (who chose to remain anonymous at this time) already, but a
few more couldn't hurt, if you catch my drift. :)

So, if you're around on AD, drop Ambea a line.
