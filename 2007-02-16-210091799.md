**Quote of the day.** From a [rest-discuss post][1] about [JSR 311: Java™ API for RESTful Web Services][2] [thanks, [Hendrik][3]]:

> This is like asking Karl Rove and Dick Cheney to write the Democratic Party
platform.

**“Bionic Seniors: Gerontomageddon”.** [Robotic suit to assist easy movement for Japan’s elderly][4]—my initial thoughts:

  1. I want one.
  2. The company is called Cyberdyne and the suit is named HAL. You do the math. 
  3. _“Suit, I need to sit down.”_ – _“I am afraid I can’t do that, old Dave.”_

[Here’s a picture.][5]

**Passion vs. brains.** [JR on the recent _“OMFG! Yahoo! is ripping off digg!!1!!”_ debacle][6]:

> I don’t want passionate users. Passionate users are morons. i want engaged
users. i want folks using products because they find them useful, beneficial
and interesting. i want folks to tell us what they like, what they don’t like,
and what would make their lives easier. i want users that regularly check out
our competitors and choose us again. Sometimes we’ll be better, sometimes they
will. Blinders only mean you miss the advantages when they happen. I’ll leave
the passionate users to the porn sites.
