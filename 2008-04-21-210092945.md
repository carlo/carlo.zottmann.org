A bit over a week ago, my grandma passed away. (More about her maybe later.)
The week between her crossing over and the funeral service I’ve subconsciously
kind of “held my breath”.

Since we got back from my parents place, where the service was held, I feel
somewhat …deflated, for lack of a better word. Out of energy, burnt out.

I guess this is normal?
