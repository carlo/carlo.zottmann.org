Evening, y’all. This is [Carlo][1], your friendly [Planet Yahoo!][2]
maintainer, with a quick note.

A few hours ago I’ve updated the [engine][3] that aggregates all the different
[Yahoo!][4] blogs into the big purple blob that is Planet Yahoo!. Said update
adds better ordering of the blog entries, and the feed parsing should be more
solid. Most changes are under the hood, so nothing too interesting for the end
user, i.e. you.

And it’s the same as with any update: while I don’t think there’ll be
problems, it might turn out I was wrong. Heh.

One minor issue: the [syndication feed][5] will be marked as “fully updated”;
so a number of older entries that you’ve already marked read in your
newsreader might pop up as unread again. Not to worry, this will only happen
once.

The good news is that in the process I’ve decided to spend some time to build
a better (pardon the audacity), yet unofficial feed for the [Yahoo!
Research][6] site. Also, I’ve updated the [MyBlogLog][7] badge, even though I
know that most of the readers never visit the site, but just subscribe to the
feed.

And that’s it for today about PY!. Cheers! -C.

PS: The rest of my wacky daily adventures is currently been prepared for a
multi-part TV treatment over at [my blog][1]. But you might know that already.
