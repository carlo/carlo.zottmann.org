So, yesterday I was on the class reunion. We've graduated 13 years ago, and
obviously a lot has happened. The evening was actually quite pleasant, and I
had some good talks. Hell, I've even managed to make one demon of the past
disappearâ€¦ and that was indeed a great thing.

So, it was a good night, and now I'm back home in Munich again. Somehow this
evening with all the talking, all it's memories past brought up again, this
reminiscence as such makes me feel home right here, away from the places of my
schooltime, even more. Not necessarily a bad thing. It's just that I've seen
what some of them have made off their lives so far, or even better, what they
didn't make. Many of us have left this town, this part of Germany, and they've
found a future somewhere else, but some have stayed there, and a few of them
looked like they've lost their faith somehow. It might sound harsh, but I'm
happy I'm not one of them.

When I was a child, it was a good place to live in. I had a good home. When I
matured, I outgrew the place, and one day, I've left.

Looking back now, all these years later, is strange. Old thoughts, buried in
my subconciousness for a long time, emerged again. My school years are back in
my head now. I don't feel like talking about it much, and I even doubt the
memories will affect me in any way, but I guess the memories of events now
past will be there for a couple of days.
