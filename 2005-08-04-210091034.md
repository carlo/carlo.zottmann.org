We had tickets for the U2 concert here in Munich last night, and we had a
blast. Great concert. Bono saved the World two times, I think. :) Unsorted
impressions: too much rain (1.5 hours, we were soaking wet), _Keane_ as
warming-up band, I stood in line for beer for 45 damn minutes, public
transportation was overloaded ('twas like Woodstock without the music), nice
symbolic slogan (["CoeXisT"][1]), too frickin' loud.

Seriously, too loud.

Admitted, the U2 boys are a tad older than us, and older people tend to have
bad hearing, but we had protective earplugs put in, and only then it was
manageable -- so, no. Too loud. My ears still feel like they're under slight
pressure.

Other than that: 2 hours of solid U2 goodness. Woooooo! :)
