While zapping around the channels last night, I came across a live broadcast
of the launch of [Ariane 5 Flight 155][1]. In case you don't know, It orbited
a dual payload of telecommunications and weather satellites for [ESA][2]'s
European customers.

It was very cool to see the last few minutes before the actual launch, to see
how the countdown was stopped and reset to 7:00 minutes due to weather
problems, to see this [sleak beauty][3] take off and leave the planet. It
reminded me how much progress the human race has made in its technological
evolution. I wonder what we could achieve if we'd all work together. Not just
in terms of space flight, but in terms of feeding the hungry, getting Africa
and the rest of the 3rd World up and running properly, getting the climate
back on track and making this planet a more enjoyable place alltogether.
