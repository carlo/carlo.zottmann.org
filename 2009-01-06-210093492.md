As mentioned earlier, Yahoo! decided to shut down its entire Munich
engineering department. So since January 1st, I am officially out of a job.

What a downer… or is it?

After some deliberation and discussions with Dana, I've decided to concentrate
on the bright side: I have a few ideas for products (read: websites), and now
I finally have the time to work on them. I've always contemplated building
them in my spare time while still being employed, but apart from a few
[small][1] [experiments][2] (which were fun to write but are hardly my
personal "next big thing") that concept didn't work out so well.

Thus, I've decided to concentrate on my own stuff in 2009 — full frontal self-
employment. That's right, I'm an entrepreneur now. [^1]

I plan on spending about half a year to bring my ideas to life, and then
taking on freelance jobs later on to bolster the income these site will
(hopefully) generate. My ideas are related to gaming, both because it's
something I love and because I am definitely seeing a market there. I think my
concept is sound, and I know I can build this …thing. It won't be easy, but I
have no problems working for my money. ;)

I don't know whether it will work out or not, but I want, nay, _need_ to try.
The time certainly is as right as it gets. Actually, one could argue that I've
waited a bit too long with my idea, since a "contender" appeared on the scene
a short time ago. [^2] But I don't see this as a showstopper, quite the
contrary — [it's good to have competition][5] as it keeps you on your toes. :)

So, 2009: it's going to be _my_ year. It's a grand experiment, and while
working alone I won't be alone, as my wonderful wife and my friends are
supporting me. Still, I don't know yet whether I will succeed or if this kind
of thing will be working for me. Quite honestly, this makes me a wee bit
nervous.

Nonetheless, full steam ahead!

Yes I can.


[^1]: Actually, officially not yet, as there's still a bit of paperwork to
      work through with a small number of different parties, but this won't
      have any effect on the decision already made.

[^2]: I could say he stole my idea, but that'd be bullshit: I didn't tell it
      to anyone, and besides — ideas are cheap, they only count when you
      pursue them.
