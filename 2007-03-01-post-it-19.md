**Description vs. person.** [defective yeti on match.com discrepancies][1]. Well summed up.

**Tables suck.** Depending on the context, of course. The topic came up on one of [our][2] internal mailing lists, and [Chris][3] answered with a link to [Why tables for layout is stupid][4], which is a really nice URL to hand out the next time the issue is raised. Great artwork, too! Go luck.

**Blog nirvana.** Valleywag came up with an interesting [heatmap][5]. Reminds me of [Lem’s ‘Rough guide to the state of the Internet, circa 2006’][6].
