["What happens after Yahoo! acquires you"](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2777-what-happens-after-yahoo-acquires-you)
over at 37signals.com is an interesting read.

Funny story from the Yahoo! trenches: a few years after Y! had acquired
del.icio.us there still was no internal bookmarking service. There were a lot
of pleas from the tech-minded folks to set up an internal del.icio.us
instance, which fell on deaf ears. I believe it was [Leonard
Lin](http://randomfoo.net) of the Upcoming team who then installed a copy of
Scuttle, an open-source del.icio.us clone, more or less in his spare time, so
we had at least some degree of social bookmarking. (It’s rather handy in team
environments in case you’re wondering.)
