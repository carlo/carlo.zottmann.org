I have to admit, I really like my new setup. [tail -f carlo.log][1] for the
“real” blog posts and [tail -f carlo.tumblr][2] for the random sillyness and
interesting bits and pieces I come across. It works out well and has some
advantages over writing a [Post-It post][3] every now and then.

It’s more …_direct_.

So I think I’ll keep using/maintaining [it][2]. Remember, it has a separate
[RSS feed][4].
