I ran my first continuous 5km today. My workouts are 5km+ already, but usually
I follow a run-walk-run-walk-run routine (2km running, 500m walking, repeat).

This morning I just didn’t stop running until I was back home again, 25
minutes later, which means my “just keep going” pace is ~4:50 min/km.

Damn, I am proud of myself. Harr!
