(What a title…) I was pulling my hair out over the last two days when I was
implementing bulk operations in a project of mine.

In this case, the list of operations to do in bulk is compiled in the browser,
and then the single requests are sent one by one to the server as single AJAX
requests. (Think "mark this as read" functionality.)

My problem was that the first and second call in the bulk list usually went
through well, but the rest of the calls just ran against a wall since all of a
sudden Rails had problems finding the either logged in user or was missing
certain methods and/or attributes. Highly annoying as well as completely
erratic, as I was sure my code was okay in the first place.

When trying the same operations on a one-by-one basis, all was good. No issues
whatsoever.

So while trying to figure out what the fuck was going on, I've played around
with different ways to get the current user, checking for the availability of
its methods and so on, all to no avail.

At one point I've disabled the `protect_from_forgery` call, and one or two
different errors started to appear:

> `A copy of ApplicationController has been removed from the module tree but
is still active`

That was new. So I've started digging around for an answer, and found it in an
old [Ruby Forum thread][1].

Turns out that Rails' development mode was the culprit, as the app's code is
reloaded on every request; so when a lot of concurrent calls are made, the
code might reload slower than the calls are coming in and hijinks ensues.

The overly simple solution to this problem? In
`/config/environments/development.rb`, I just set `config.cache_classes` to
`true`, meaning the code isn't reloaded all the time — and as it turns out, my
code runs just fine after all! Happy happy joy joy.

The downside is that I'll have to restart my dev server every time I make a
code change, but in this particular case, that's not a big deal.
