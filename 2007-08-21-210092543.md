I found a few versions of this in my inbox a few minutes ago:

possibly incriminating links to my various social network profiles, and that
is so nice of you.

here”_ link at the bottom of each unsolicited mail you’ve sent me. So what? I
didn’t opt in for these mails in the first place. Someone searched for my
email address, and you’ve simply used it to send out advertising. Face it:
That’s what it is.

Okay, listen up, dear clueless people at
