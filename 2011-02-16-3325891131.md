>> Apple’s new rules rile. But not me: I’m the paying customer and I resent
the old model. The new rules are customer-centric.

> Like, for example, with data sharing. Apple won’t share your personal
information to publishers without your permission. Publishers want unfettered
access to that information because they want to sell it, because that’s what
they’ve been doing with subscriber information for decades.
