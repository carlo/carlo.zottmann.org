A breakthru for mankind: I'm writing this entry using my lap. Well, the iBook
sitting on my lap, to be precise. I love this thing. (The iBook.) Great piece
of hardware, definitely a keeper. Which, of course, is directly connected to
the rather hefty price tag. Then again, it was a breeze to set up and connect
to the Internet, too, and it's a rather pleasant experience alltogether after
all so far.

How to connect an iBook to a (Windows) LAN:

a) Plugin LAN cable. b) Use the network properties to either use the
"automatic connection type guessing gizmo" or simply enter the wanted IP
address. c) Done.

Whaddaya know, that's it. No hassle, no reboots, just workie. I start to
believe the Apple marketing department didn't lie after all. ;)

Oh, and speaking of gizmosâ€¦ this baby is oozing style and gizmos and style
gizmos. For example, when you close the iBook, it'll enter sleep mode. How do
you see it's in sleep mode? There's a little soft light on it, and it's
pulsating in the same frequency as a baby asleep. I love it. :)
