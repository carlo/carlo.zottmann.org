I’m [in the running business][1] for a bit over a week so far. I’ve managed to
finish the first four runs without breaking down, getting hit by a car, having
to cry, falling or getting lost; and without dropping a single run.

I’m kind of proud of myself.

Using an unnamed maps site, I’ve laid out a nice 4.5km route in the
neighbourhood. My first route was only 3.75km, which turned out to be too
short. I got home while [the music][2] was still playing… unacceptable. So,
back to the drawing board, add a few streets, great.

I still don’t like it. The second half of each go is nice, tho… because I know
I’m about to get home.

Nevermind, I’ll keep on doing it. Can’t hurt, and it makes me feel better.

Unless I break down, get hit by a car, have to cry, fall or get lost, that is.
