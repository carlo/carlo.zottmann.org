[Good news for the Jabber movement][1]: "The Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF), the group that sets the technical standards for the Internet, gave the
go-ahead to the creators of open-source instant-messaging application Jabber
to create a working group based on that technology. These such groups plan the
specific implementations of the technologies that make up the Internet. […"]

Had the weirdest dream last night. I dreamed my sis borrowed my car, and when
she returned it, it was seriously dented at several spots. So far, so good,
but guess what: I _woke up and was totally pissed at her_. Luckily I noticed
that it was just a dream before calling and yelling at her. ;)

The [Folding@Home][2] Windows GUI doesn't really like XP. It runs, no problems
there, but it acts up, messing up other apps' tooltips etc… Very strange. The
console client is much better. So, that means that I'll restrict my
participation in the project to my office machines. _shrug_ Ah well, I guess
it's meant to run on office and school machines anyways… need all the spare
CPU cycles at home for myself. ;)
