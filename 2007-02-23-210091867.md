The good fight against blog comment spam continues—I’ve added [HashCash][1] to
the mix after noticing the Akismet plugin catching up to 250 spam comments
_per night_. Let’s see whether with HashCash this number goes down; after all
it is supposed to stop bots, so the comments shouldn’t end up in Akismets
queue in the first place. If you have problems posting comments (if you want
to comment here for whatever reason… can’t think of anything at the moment),
drop me a line. My mail address can be found around here, you know where to
look. **Update:** I deactivated HashCash again. After Akismet had to filter
out ~50 spam comments in the last two hours, it became clear to me that
HashCash doesn’t help at all. Awesome! :P

**Update #2:** It dawned me that pretty much all of my incoming spam is [trackbacks][2], and HashCash doesn’t process those for apparent reasons. Huh.
