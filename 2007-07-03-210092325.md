Dear Perl community,

I just wasted 15 minutes of my life trying to figure out how to get the index
of a particular element in an array. Turns out I have to write a `for` loop to
walk through the array. This is insulting.

Seriously, it’s 2007. If at this point in time you’re still defending your
beloved language and/or using words like “elegant” or “quick” when describing
Perl, you’re _bat shit crazy_. My 2c.

Love, Carlo.

**Addendum, 2007-07-04, 9:14 CEST:** I forgot to mention a few things.

  * It wasn’t my choice to use Perl, I just have to deal with it.
  * I was talking about a _very_ limited set of _unique_ strings.
  * The [Perl Cookbook][1] offered a solution, which is seven lines of code, the core being a `for` loop.
