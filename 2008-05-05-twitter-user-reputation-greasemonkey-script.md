Remember the other day, [when I told you about the user reputation
features][1] in [Twerp Scan][2]? Yeah, good times.

Anyways, today I’ve cobbled together a [quick Greasemonkey script][3] to
display the reputation and voting thumbs on Twitter user pages, right above
the “About” portion in the sidebar. Like so:

So this means that you can see on a glance whether someone is naughty or nice,
right on his or her user page. And you can vote right there, on the spot, if
you feel like, and this will of course feed the same database as you rating
your contacts in [Twerp Scan][2].

Use [Greasemonkey][5] for Firefox or [GreaseKit][6] for Safari to [install the
script][3], and then visit [any Twitter user page][7].
