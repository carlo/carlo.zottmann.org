A few weeks ago I was minding my own business at [work][1], writing a
[Greasemonkey][2] script to solve a problem I had, when I noticed that
apparently I had found the solution for a GM problem that not only I had but a
number of other people as well. So, I tinkered and tinkered and tinkered some
more and discovered that I had managed to write something fairly wicked that I
had never seen before.

Now, when it comes to my own code, I always tend to be somewhat cautious about
getting too excited about it. I myself might find it pretty cool and elegant,
but I always have the nagging feeling that I might have overlooked some
glaring problem or messed up otherwise. (Interestingly enough this behaviour
surfaced around the time I started working at Yahoo!. Heh. That’s what happens
when you know there [are][3] [real][4] [top][5] [dogs][6] [around][7].
Honestly, we pack some serious talent around the world, which can feel a bit
frightening at times.)

Anyways, I finished it up and posted it on one of our internal mailing lists,
and after getting back some very encouraging comments I decided to show it to
[Eric][8], one of our major Javascript famosos.

Turns out he found it interesting enough to ask me whether I want to write an
article for one of our public dev blogs. Holy crap.

So yesterday I finished a working example, and today I’ve submitted my
article. When all goes well, and after some (hopefully) serious proof-reading
(to make sure I don’t make a fool out of myself after all), it will be
presented to the interwebs.

Now, I don’t want to tell you where or what, mostly because I am getting
increasingly paranoid about bragging. But quite frankly, I am amazed I made it
this far, and even if it isn’t published after all, at least it was considered
interesting enough to let me take a shot there.

And for me, that is quite something.
